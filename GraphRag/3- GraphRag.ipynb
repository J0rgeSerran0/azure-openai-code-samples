It is the fourth-highest-grossing film series, with $7.7 billion in worldwide receipts.\\n\\n\\n== Origins ==\\nIn late 1997, film producer David Heyman\\'s London offices received a copy of the first book in what would become Rowling\\'s series of seven Harry Potter novels. The book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher\\'s Stone, was relegated to a low-priority bookshelf, where it was discovered by a secretary who read it and gave it to Heyman with a positive review. Consequently, Heyman, who had originally disliked \"the rubbish title\", read the book himself. Highly impressed by Rowling\\'s work, he began the process that led to one of the most successful cinematic franchises of all time.\\nHeyman\\'s enthusiasm led to Rowling\\'s 1999 sale of the film rights for the first four Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. for a reported £1 million (US$2,000,000). A demand Rowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British and Irish wherever possible, such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore, allowing nonetheless for casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such. Rowling was hesitant to sell the rights because she \"didn\\'t want to give them control over the rest of the story\" by selling the rights to the characters, which would have enabled Warner Bros. to make non-author-written sequels.\\nAlthough Steven Spielberg initially negotiated to direct the first film, he declined the offer. Spielberg contended that, in his opinion, there was every expectation of profit in making the film. He claims that making money would have been like \"shooting ducks in a barrel. It\\'s just a slam dunk. It\\'s just like withdrawing a billion dollars and putting it into your personal bank accounts. There\\'s no challenge.\" In the \"Rubbish Bin\" section of her website, Rowling maintains that she had no role in choosing directors for the films, writing \"Anyone who thinks I could (or would) have \\'veto-ed\\' him [Spielberg] needs their Quick-Quotes Quill serviced.\"\\nAfter Spielberg left, conversations began with other directors, including Chris Columbus, Jonathan Demme, Terry Gilliam, Mike Newell, Alan Parker, Wolfgang Petersen, Rob Reiner, Tim Robbins, Brad Silberling, and Peter Weir. Petersen and Reiner both pulled out of the running in March 2000. It was then narrowed down to Columbus, Gilliam, Parker, and Silberling. Rowling\\'s first choice was Gilliam. However, on 28 March 2000 Columbus was appointed as director of the film, with Warner Bros. citing his work on other family films such as Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire as influences for')],\n",
