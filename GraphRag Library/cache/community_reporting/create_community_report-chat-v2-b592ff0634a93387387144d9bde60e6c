He is a little negro lad who plays a role in the ship's crew, indicated by his association with striking the bell and playing the tambourine. Pip is known for his loyalty and determination, as seen by his eagerness to follow Captain Ahab from the cabin-gangway, and Ahab himself expresses a desire to talk with Pip and learn from his philosophies.\n\nDespite his initial bright demeanor, Pip undergoes a traumatic transformation after being thrown overboard during a whale hunt and subsequently left behind by the crew. This harrowing experience leads him to become an idiot, as his shipmates describe him, after he claims to have seen God. His behavior becomes erratic, characterized by a wretched laugh, an idle but unresting eye, and strange mummeries that blend with the melancholy atmosphere of the ship. His face is described as having an unearthly idiot expression, and he is involved in the interpretation of the doubloon.\n\nPip's fear is evident when he comments on the white squalls and is referred to as a coward by others. He is found to be sulky and sleepy at times, and despite his state, he is asked to play the tambourine. His relationship with other crew members is complex; he approaches Queequeg as he lies in a coffin, expressing sorrow and asking Queequeg to perform a task for him if he reaches the Antilles.\n\nUnfortunately, Pip is also described as having died a shivering death, jumping from a whale-boat, which may be a metaphorical description of his mental state post-trauma rather than a literal death, as he is also mentioned as currently missing and then found.
