It is owned primarily by Bildad and Peleg and is captained by Ahab, who commands the ship despite his missing leg, thanks to a mechanical contrivance. The ship is known for its whaling activities, with its crew, including Stubb and the harpooneers, living more out of the cabin than in it. The ship embarks on a whaling voyage, often penetrating further into the heart of the Japanese cruising ground, and is always astir in the fishery. The Pequod is also the ship that Ishmael decides to sail on for a three or four years\u2019 voyage in uncivilized and far-distant seas. The ship is described as making good speed through the water and is often involved in interactions with other ships, such as The Rachel and The Jeroboam. It is also known to come to the rescue, parting the whale from its victim, and is the place where the whale purchased by Stubb is brought. However, the ship is also described as sinking in the text and is involved in a confrontation with a typhoon. Despite these challenges, the crew, including Ahab, continue their vengeful errand on The Pequod, which is seen as an entity invested with a preternaturalness.\",40\r\n11,\"\"\"NANTUCKET\"\"\",\"Nantucket is a small island off the coast of Massachusetts, renowned for its historic whaling industry. It is frequently mentioned throughout the narrative, often as a significant location for the characters and events described. Nantucket is associated with a vial of sand that Ahab carries, and it is where Peleg promises to have a hot supper waiting for the crew in three years. Queequeg visits Nantucket and observes how sailors spend their wages, which influences his decisions. The island is home to Captain Pollard and is a place where some inhabitants express skepticism about the story of Jonah and the whale.\n\nMany of the island's residents are Quakers and invest their money in whaling vessels. Queequeg mentions seeing dark wooden canoes used for burial on Nantucket, a custom he desires for himself. Ahab reflects on Nantucket, suggesting it may be his place of origin or holds significant meaning for him. The island is also referenced in Daniel Webster's speech in the U.S. Senate and serves as a cautionary tale for ship-owners about enlisting certain individuals in their fisheries.\n\nFrederick Cuvier's depiction of the Sperm Whale includes Nantucket, and the island is a place of longing and home for many characters. It is possibly the setting for the events described and is where Radney may have spent his infancy. The island's history with whaling is a draw for those wishing to sail from it, including Ahab, who steps ashore there at the end of his journey. Whales and whaling scenes are carved by fishermen on Nantucket, and it is where the narrator and Queequeg board a packet schooner.\n\nNantucket has supplied many daring harpooneers and was once sought after by Louis XVI, who invited families from the island to Dunkirk. Radney's widow still resides there, and the island is described as unique and isolated with a rich history and strong connection to the sea. It is known for its whale fishery and as a place where tattooed savages sailing in ships eventually convert into the churches. Not everyone on Nantucket knows the full story of Ahab's past, but it is the home port of the ship where the owners could stand and yell.\n\nQueequeg speculates that the god who made sharks might originate from Nantucket, and mysterious shadows were seen creeping on board the Pequod there. The island serves as a market\",20\r\n8,\"\"\"ISHMAEL\"\"\",\"Ishmael is the narrator of the story and a sailor on the Pequod. He is a philosophical and introspective man, deeply reflective on the nature of whaling and life. Throughout the narrative, Ishmael observes an argument between Bildad and Peleg and is subsequently offered a position on the ship. He is part of the crew and, at some point, takes an oath of violence and revenge against the whale, which suggests a complex relationship with the creature and the whaling life. Ishmael is also addressed directly in the text, indicating his role as a whaleman who may share fears similar to those of a mariner. In his quest for understanding, he attempts to describe the Sperm Whale and the broader implications of its existence. Additionally, Ishmael is seen looking for a place to eat and sleep in New Bedford, which grounds his character in the practical realities of life at sea. His narrative provides a window into the whaling world and the human condition, as he grapples with his experiences and observations aboard the Pequod.\",18\r\n22,\"\"\"THE DELIGHT\"\"\",\"\"\"The Delight\"\" is a ship that the Pequod encounters in the text.

It is described as having all her spars thickly clustering with men, indicating a significant crew presence.
