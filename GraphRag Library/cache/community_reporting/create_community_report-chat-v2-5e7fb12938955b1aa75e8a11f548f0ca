He is a central figure in a Hebrew story where he is swallowed by a whale, a narrative that draws parallels with Hercules. This story is believed to have led him to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope. Despite his eventual obedience, Jonah is often referred to as a cursed figure, likened to a little withered old man who sells sailors deliriums and death.
