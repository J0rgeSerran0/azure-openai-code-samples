It is a biblical sea monster, images of which are found in the petrified forms of rocks at the base of high broken cliffs. In the text, Leviathan is described as playing on the ocean and having a powerful, unique tail that acts differently from other sea creatures. It is used for various motions and is graceful yet powerful. Leviathan is also another name for the Sperm Whale, used to emphasize its size, power, grandeur, and complexity. \n\nThe term \"\"Leviathan\"\" is also used metaphorically to describe an event or entity that the narrator has chased around the North Pole. It is associated with a place where whales are hunted, as indicated by the mention of harpoons and cobblestones. This place is described as banished and unconquerable, bearing a mark on its back. Leviathan is also the event of hunting and processing a whale, particularly in the context of obtaining 'nippers' from its tail. \n\nLeviathan is a whale that is being hunted by the crew of the Pequod. It is described as a massive creature, capable of hiding under the mountains of the sea and causing great difficulty for the hunters.
