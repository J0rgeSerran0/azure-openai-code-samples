He is the second mate on the Pequod, a whaling ship, and is known for his good-humored, easy-going, and careless nature, which may be attributed to his continual smoking of a pipe. Stubb is a native of Cape Cod and is described as fish-like, jolly, and unfearing, with a demeanor that is indifferent to perils. He handles his duties with a calm and collected approach, often managing his steering-oar in a lounging manner and is seen as a humorist who says terrifying things in a tone of fun and fury.\n\nDuring the story, Stubb is involved in various aspects of the ship's operations, including strenuous exertions during a typhoon, whale hunts, and the race to catch whales. He takes on a leadership role, directly engaging with the whales, and is confident and encouraging towards his team. Stubb is also known for his peculiar way of talking to his crew and has a reputation for being a high liver who enjoys the flavor of whale meat. He is seen eating whale by its own light and sets the anchor-watch after his supper.\n\nStubb's interactions with other characters are multifaceted. He has conversations with Starbuck, reflecting on fate and predestination, and with Flask, discussing risks and precautions on the ship. He also interacts with the cook, Fleece, criticizing his preparation of a steak and instructing him on how to properly cook a whale-steak. Stubb's interactions extend to other ships' crews, such as Derick De Deer and the French ship's crew, and he is involved in plans to circumvent and satirize a captain.\n\nDespite his generally humorous perspective, Stubb shows concern for his fellow crew members, such as Ahab's well-being and the method of rescue for Tashtego. He is also seen taking action to prevent the sinking of the ship, showing leadership and quick thinking. Stubb's character is complex, as he is also described as easy-going and unfearing, yet he can be confrontational, as seen when he speaks about Fedallah, the devil, and a whale.\n\nStubb's relationship with Ahab is notable; he observes and comments on Ahab's actions and statements, showing a mix of determination and resignation in the face of the whale.
