The Whale's actions and detailed physiology cause a flurry of activity and imbalance on the ship. The author attempts to describe The Whale in great detail, using it as a metaphor for a large and expansive theme. The Whale's skin and blubber are compared to various objects and concepts, making it the central focus of the text. \n\nIn the story, The Whale is the antagonist, causing conflict and danger for Ahab and his crew. It is initially unaware of the crew's pursuit but later becomes aware and attempts to escape, moving swiftly and challenging the crew's skills. The Whale shows signs of fear and distress during the chase, and is ultimately killed. \n\nThe Whale is also referred to in several significant events. It is known for swallowing Jonah, symbolizing his trials and redemption, and later vomiting him out. It is also seen breaching from the sea, causing chaos among the characters.
