{"result": "\"CAPTAIN\" is a character who appears to be in charge, giving orders to others and is responsible for the navigation and general management of the vessel in the whale-craft. He has experienced personal loss, having lost his son, and sought help from Ahab. The Captain is also known for his confrontational nature, as seen when he confronts Queequeg about his actions and threatens him. He is also seen dancing up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle Steelkilt, and later threatening the insurgents with a pistol. He is suspicious of Jonah, charging him thrice the usual sum for passage and testing the authenticity of his coins, but eventually allows Jonah to board the ship.
