Leviathan is another name for the Sperm Whale, used to emphasize its size, power, grandeur, and complexity. It is described as a massive creature, capable of hiding under the mountains of the sea and causing great difficulty for the hunters. It is also associated with a unique tail that acts differently from other sea creatures, having a powerful and graceful tail that is used for various motions. \n\nLeviathan is also referred to as a place that is banished and unconquerable, bearing a mark on its back. It is a location where whales are hunted, as indicated by the mention of harpoons and cobblestones. The term is also used to refer to the event of hunting and processing a whale, particularly in the context of obtaining 'nippers' from its tail. \n\nLeviathan is a metaphorical event or entity that the narrator has chased around the North Pole.
