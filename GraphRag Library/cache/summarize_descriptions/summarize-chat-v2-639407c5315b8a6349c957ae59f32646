{"result": "Captain Bildad is a well-to-do, retired whaleman who was educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism. He is one of the largest owners of the vessel, the Pequod, and is a Quaker. He is also an agent of the ship, sharing ownership with Captain Peleg. Captain Bildad is known for his interactions with Queequeg and the narrator, often giving advice to the crew before they depart. He is particularly remembered for giving Queequeg a tract titled 'The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose', warning him about the dangers of clinging to Pagan ways and demanding proof of Queequeg's conversion. He is also involved in conversations about church membership and baptism, indicating his position of authority.
