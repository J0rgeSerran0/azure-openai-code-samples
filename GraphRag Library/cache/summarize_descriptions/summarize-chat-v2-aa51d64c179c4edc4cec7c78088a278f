{"result": "Cape Horn is a significant geographical location, mentioned frequently in the narrative. It is the southernmost headland of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago of southern Chile. Its importance in maritime navigation is highlighted by the fact that ships, including the whale fishery, often have to sail around it. The narrative also mentions that Ahab sailed to Cape Horn immediately after his marriage, indicating a significant event in his past.
