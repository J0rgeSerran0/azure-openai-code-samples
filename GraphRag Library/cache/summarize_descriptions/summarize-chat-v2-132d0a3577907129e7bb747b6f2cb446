{"result": "\"Jonah\" is a figure from the Hebrew Bible, known for being swallowed by a whale, a story that is invoked by the narrator to support his belief that a whale is a fish. He is also mentioned in Father Mapple's sermon. His story is similar to that of Hercules, another figure who faced great trials. Jonah is believed to have traveled to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope. He is described as a prophet who initially fled from his mission and his God, but ultimately fulfilled the Almighty's bidding.
