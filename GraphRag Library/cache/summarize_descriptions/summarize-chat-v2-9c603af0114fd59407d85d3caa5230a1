Radney, known for his brutal and overbearing nature, does not harbor any affection for Steelkilt, a fact of which Steelkilt is fully aware. This animosity between them is further exacerbated when Radney intervenes in a situation where the Captain decides not to flog Steelkilt. This intervention, coupled with Radney's harsh demeanor, provokes Steelkilt to seek vengeance.
