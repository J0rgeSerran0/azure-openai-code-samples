Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer\n  handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the\n  known nations of the world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it\n  somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.\n\n  \u201cWhile you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what\n  name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through\n  ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the\n  signification of the word, you deliver that which is not true.\u201d\n  \u2014_Hackluyt._\n\n  \u201cWHALE. * * * Sw. and Dan. _hval_. This animal is named from\n  roundness or rolling; for in Dan. _hvalt_ is arched or vaulted.\u201d\n  \u2014_Webster\u2019s Dictionary._\n\n  \u201cWHALE. * * * It is more immediately from the Dut. and Ger. _Wallen_;\n  A.S. _Walw-ian_, to roll, to wallow.\u201d \u2014_Richardson\u2019s Dictionary._\n\n\n  \u05d7\u05d5,                 _Hebrew_.\n  \u03f0\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2,              _Greek_.\n  CETUS,              _Latin_.\n  WH\u0152L,               _Anglo-Saxon_.\n  HVALT,              _Danish_.\n  WAL,                _Dutch_.\n  HWAL,               _Swedish_.\n  WHALE,              _Icelandic_.\n  WHALE,              _English_.\n  BALLENA,            _Spanish_.\n  PEKEE-NUEE-NUEE,    _Fegee_.\n  PEHEE-NUEE-NUEE,    _Erromangoan_.\n\n\n\n  EXTRACTS. (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian).\n\n\n\n  It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of\n  a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long\n  Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random\n  allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever,\n  sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least,\n  take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in\n  these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As\n  touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here\n  appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as\n  affording a glancing bird\u2019s eye view of what has been promiscuously\n  said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and\n  generations, including our own.\n\n  So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am.\n  Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this\n  world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too\n  rosy-strong; but with whom\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
