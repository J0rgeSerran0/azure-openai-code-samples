I\nwas going to warn ye against\u2014but never mind, never mind\u2014it\u2019s all one,\nall in the family too;\u2014sharp frost this morning, ain\u2019t it? Good-bye to\nye. Shan\u2019t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it\u2019s before the\nGrand Jury.\u201d And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving\nme, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.\n\nAt last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound\nquiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the\nhatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward\nto the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a\nlight, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a\ntattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his\nface downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber\nslept upon him.\n\n\u201cThose sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\u201d said I,\nlooking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the\nwharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I\nwould have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that\nmatter, were it not for Elijah\u2019s otherwise inexplicable question. But I\nbeat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to\nQueequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to\nestablish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper\u2019s rear,\nas though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado,\nsat quietly down there.\n\n\u201cGracious! Queequeg, don\u2019t sit there,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cOh! perry dood seat,\u201d said Queequeg, \u201cmy country way; won\u2019t hurt him\nface.\u201d\n\n\u201cFace!\u201d said I, \u201ccall that his face? very benevolent countenance then;\nbut how hard he breathes, he\u2019s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you\nare heavy, it\u2019s grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look,\nhe\u2019ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don\u2019t wake.\u201d\n\nQueequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\nlighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing\nover the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning\nhim in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his\nland, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,\nchiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening\nsome of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house\ncomfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy\nfellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was\nvery convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs\nwhich are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief\ncalling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself\nunder a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.\n\nWhile narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk\nfrom me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that for, Queequeg?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!\u201d\n\nHe was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,\nwhich, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed\nhis soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The\nstrong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to\ntell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed\ntroubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and\nrubbed his eyes.\n\n\u201cHolloa!\u201d he breathed at last, \u201cwho be ye smokers?\u201d\n\n\u201cShipped men,\u201d answered I, \u201cwhen does she sail?\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain\ncame aboard last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Captain?\u2014Ahab?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho but him indeed?\u201d\n\nI was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we\nheard a noise on deck.\n\n\u201cHolloa! Starbuck\u2019s astir,\u201d said the rigger. \u201cHe\u2019s a lively chief mate,\nthat; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.\u201d And so\nsaying he went on deck, and we followed.\n\nIt was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and\nthrees; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively\nengaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various\nlast things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly\nenshrined within his cabin.\n\n\nCHAPTER 22.
