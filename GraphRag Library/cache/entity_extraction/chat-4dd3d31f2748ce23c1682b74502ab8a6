No, thought I, there must be some sober\nreason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.\nCan it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies\nhis spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties\nand connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the\nword, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a\nself-containing stronghold\u2014a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial\nwell of water within the walls.\n\nBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\nborrowed from the chaplain\u2019s former sea-farings. Between the marble\ncenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back\nwas adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating\nagainst a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy\nbreakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there\nfloated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel\u2019s\nface; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the\nship\u2019s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into\nthe Victory\u2019s plank where Nelson fell. \u201cAh, noble ship,\u201d the angel\nseemed to say, \u201cbeat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy\nhelm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling\noff\u2014serenest azure is at hand.\u201d\n\nNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\nhad achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the\nlikeness of a ship\u2019s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\nprojecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship\u2019s fiddle-headed\nbeak.\n\nWhat could be more full of meaning?\u2014for the pulpit is ever this earth\u2019s\nforemost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the\nworld. From thence it is the storm of God\u2019s quick wrath is first\ndescried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is\nthe God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds.\nYes, the world\u2019s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete;\nand the pulpit is its prow.\n\n\nCHAPTER 9. The Sermon.\n\nFather Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered\nthe scattered people to condense. \u201cStarboard gangway, there! side away\nto larboard\u2014larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!\u201d\n\nThere was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a\nstill slighter shuffling of women\u2019s shoes, and all was quiet again, and\nevery eye on the preacher.\n\nHe paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit\u2019s bows, folded his\nlarge brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and\noffered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying\nat the bottom of the sea.\n\nThis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a\nbell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog\u2014in such tones he\ncommenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards\nthe concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy\u2014\n\n\n  \u201cThe ribs and terrors in the whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom,\n  While all God\u2019s sun-lit waves rolled by, And lift me deepening down\n  to doom.\n\n  \u201cI saw the opening maw of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there;\n  Which none but they that feel can tell\u2014 Oh, I was plunging to\n  despair.\n\n  \u201cIn black distress, I called my God, When I could scarce believe him\n  mine, He bowed his ear to my complaints\u2014 No more the whale did me\n  confine.\n\n  \u201cWith speed he flew to my relief, As on a radiant dolphin borne;\n  Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God.\n\n  \u201cMy song for ever shall record That terrible, that joyful hour; I\n  give the glory to my God, His all the mercy and the power.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nNearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the\nhowling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned\nover the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon\nthe proper page, said: \u201cBeloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the\nfirst chapter of Jonah\u2014\u2018And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up\nJonah.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cShipmates, this book, containing only four chapters\u2014four yarns\u2014is one\nof the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what\ndepths of the soul does Jonah\u2019s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant\nlesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in\nthe fish\u2019s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the\nfloods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the\nwaters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
