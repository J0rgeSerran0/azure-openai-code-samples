Meantime his ship was still increasing\nthe distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the\nPequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the\nfirst mere mention of the White Whale\u2019s name to another ship, Ahab for\na moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a\nboat to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But\ntaking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet,\nand knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer\nand shortly bound home, he loudly hailed\u2014\u201cAhoy there! This is the\nPequod, bound round the world! Tell them to address all future letters\nto the Pacific ocean! and this time three years, if I am not at home,\ntell them to address them to \u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nAt that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then,\nin accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,\nthat for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side,\ndarted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves\nfore and aft with the stranger\u2019s flanks. Though in the course of his\ncontinual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar\nsight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously\ncarry meanings.\n\n\u201cSwim away from me, do ye?\u201d murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.\nThere seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of\ndeep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced.\nBut turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in\nthe wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion\nvoice,\u2014\u201cUp helm! Keep her off round the world!\u201d\n\nRound the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;\nbut whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through\nnumberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that\nwe left behind secure, were all the time before us.\n\nWere this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for\never reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange\nthan any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise\nin the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in\ntormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims\nbefore all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they\neither lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.\n\n\nCHAPTER 53. The Gam.\n\nThe ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had\nspoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this\nnot been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded\nher\u2014judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions\u2014if so it had\nbeen that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer\nto the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not\nto consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he\ncould contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. But\nall this might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said\nhere of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other\nin foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.\n\nIf two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the\nequally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering\neach other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of\nthem, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment\nto interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and\nresting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the\nillimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling\nvessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth\u2014off lone\nFanning\u2019s Island, or the far away King\u2019s Mills; how much more natural,\nI say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only\ninterchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and\nsociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of\ncourse, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose\ncaptains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to\neach other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to\ntalk about.\n\nFor the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on\nboard; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a\ndate a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and\nthumb-worn files. And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound\nship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the\ncruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost\nimportance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true concerning\nwhaling vessels crossing each other\u2019s track on the cruising-ground\nitself, even though they are equally long absent from home. For one of\nthem may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and now\nfar remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the people of\nthe ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whaling news,\nand have an agreeable chat.
