For the instant he almost turns to flee again.\nBut he rallies. \u2018I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon\nsail ye, sir?\u2019 Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,\nthough the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that\nhollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. \u2018We sail with the\nnext coming tide,\u2019 at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing\nhim. \u2018No sooner, sir?\u2019\u2014\u2018Soon enough for any honest man that goes a\npassenger.\u2019 Ha! Jonah, that\u2019s another stab. But he swiftly calls away\nthe Captain from that scent. \u2018I\u2019ll sail with ye,\u2019\u2014he says,\u2014\u2018the passage\nmoney how much is that?\u2014I\u2019ll pay now.\u2019 For it is particularly written,\nshipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history,\n\u2018that he paid the fare thereof\u2019 ere the craft did sail. And taken with\nthe context, this is full of meaning.\n\n\u201cNow Jonah\u2019s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects\ncrime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In\nthis world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and\nwithout a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all\nfrontiers. So Jonah\u2019s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah\u2019s\npurse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;\nand it\u2019s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;\nbut at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with\ngold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions\nstill molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.\nNot a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his\npassage. \u2018Point out my state-room, Sir,\u2019 says Jonah now, \u2018I\u2019m\ntravel-weary; I need sleep.\u2019 \u2018Thou lookest like it,\u2019 says the Captain,\n\u2018there\u2019s thy room.\u2019 Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock\ncontains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain\nlaughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of\nconvicts\u2019 cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed\nand dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the\nlittle state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is\nclose, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,\nbeneath the ship\u2019s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment\nof that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of\nhis bowels\u2019 wards.\n\n\u201cScrewed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly\noscillates in Jonah\u2019s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the\nwharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and\nall, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity\nwith reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight\nitself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it\nhung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his\ntormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful\nfugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that\ncontradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the\nceiling, and the side, are all awry. \u2018Oh! so my conscience hangs in\nme!\u2019 he groans, \u2018straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my\nsoul are all in crookedness!\u2019\n\n\u201cLike one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\nreeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the\nRoman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him;\nas one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy\nanguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at\nlast amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as\nover the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and\nthere\u2019s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth,\nJonah\u2019s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.\n\n\u201cAnd now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and\nfrom the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,\nglides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded\nsmugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not\nbear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to\nbreak. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when\nboxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is\nshrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with\ntrampling feet right over Jonah\u2019s head; in all this raging tumult,\nJonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea,\nfeels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far\nrush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving\nthe seas after him.
