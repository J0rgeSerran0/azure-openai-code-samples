Quick!\u201d\n\n\u201cAvast!\u201d cried Ahab; \u201clet\u2019s have fair play here, though we be the\nweaker side. Yet I\u2019ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and\nAndes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let\nthem be, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook aloft!\u201d cried Starbuck. \u201cThe corpusants! the corpusants!\u201d\n\nAll the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each\ntri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of\nthe three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like\nthree gigantic wax tapers before an altar.\n\n\u201cBlast the boat! let it go!\u201d cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing\nsea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently\njammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. \u201cBlast it!\u201d\u2014but slipping\nbackward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and\nimmediately shifting his tone he cried\u2014\u201cThe corpusants have mercy on us\nall!\u201d\n\nTo sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of\nthe calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses\nfrom the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething\nsea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when\nGod\u2019s burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His \u201cMene, Mene,\nTekel Upharsin\u201d has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.\n\nWhile this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the\nenchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all\ntheir eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away\nconstellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the\ngigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and\nseemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted\nmouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely\ngleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by\nthe preternatural light, Queequeg\u2019s tattooing burned like Satanic blue\nflames on his body.\n\nThe tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more\nthe Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment\nor two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one.\nIt was Stubb. \u201cWhat thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not\nthe same in the song.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, it wasn\u2019t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I\nhope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?\u2014have\nthey no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck\u2014but it\u2019s too dark\nto look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign\nof good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be\nchock a\u2019 block with sperm-oil, d\u2019ye see; and so, all that sperm will\nwork up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will\nyet be as three spermaceti candles\u2014that\u2019s the good promise we saw.\u201d\n\nAt that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb\u2019s face slowly beginning\nto glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: \u201cSee! see!\u201d and once\nmore the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled\nsupernaturalness in their pallor.\n\n\u201cThe corpusants have mercy on us all,\u201d cried Stubb, again.\n\nAt the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,\nthe Parsee was kneeling in Ahab\u2019s front, but with his head bowed away\nfrom him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where\nthey had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,\narrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a\nknot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various\nenchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running\nskeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all\ntheir eyes upcast.\n\n\u201cAye, aye, men!\u201d cried Ahab. \u201cLook up at it; mark it well; the white\nflame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast\nlinks there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against\nit; blood against fire! So.\u201d\n\nThen turning\u2014the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot\nupon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,\nhe stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.\n\n\u201cOh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian\nonce did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that\nto this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I\nnow know that thy right worship is defiance.
