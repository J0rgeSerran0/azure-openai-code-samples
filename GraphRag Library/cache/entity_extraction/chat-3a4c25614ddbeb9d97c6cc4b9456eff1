All\nthat most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things;\nall truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the\nbrain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy\nAhab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby\nDick. He piled upon the whale\u2019s white hump the sum of all the general\nrage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if\nhis chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart\u2019s shell upon it.\n\nIt is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at\nthe precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the\nmonster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,\ncorporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he\nprobably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.\nYet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long\nmonths of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in\none hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian\nCape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one\nanother; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on\nthe homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania\nseized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals\nduring the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a\nleg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was\nmoreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to\nlace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a\nstrait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when\nrunning into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun\u2019sails\nspread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances,\nthe old man\u2019s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn\nswells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and\nair; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,\nand issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the\ndireful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self,\nraved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.\nWhen you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some\nstill subtler form. Ahab\u2019s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly\ncontracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows\nnarrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his\nnarrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab\u2019s broad madness had been\nleft behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural\nintellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living\ninstrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy\nstormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its\nconcentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost\nhis strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold\nmore potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one\nreasonable object.\n\nThis is much; yet Ahab\u2019s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.\nBut vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding\nfar down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where\nwe here stand\u2014however grand and wonderful, now quit it;\u2014and take your\nway, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;\nwhere far beneath the fantastic towers of man\u2019s upper earth, his root\nof grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique\nburied beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken\nthrone, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he\npatient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of\nages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that\nproud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young\nexiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old\nState-secret come.\n\nNow, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means\nare sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or\nchange, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long\ndissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling\nwas only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.\nNevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when\nwith ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him\notherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the\nterrible casualty which had\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
