There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard,\nwhich, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal\ngroves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin\nwas recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the\norder, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent\npromptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took\nQueequeg\u2019s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg\u2019s\nperson as he shifted the rule.\n\n\u201cAh! poor fellow! he\u2019ll have to die now,\u201d ejaculated the Long Island\nsailor.\n\nGoing to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general\nreference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the\ncoffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two\nnotches at its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his\ntools, and to work.\n\nWhen the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he\nlightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring\nwhether they were ready for it yet in that direction.\n\nOverhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people\non deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one\u2019s\nconsternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to\nhim, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some\ndying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will\nshortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be\nindulged.\n\nLeaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an\nattentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock\ndrawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along\nwith one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also,\nbiscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh\nwater was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up\nin the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for\na pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that\nhe might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without\nmoving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his\nlittle god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo\nbetween, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed\nover him. The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay\nQueequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in\nview. \u201cRarmai\u201d (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and\nsigned to be replaced in his hammock.\n\nBut ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all\nthis while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took\nhim by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.\n\n\u201cPoor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where\ngo ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where\nthe beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little\nerrand for me? Seek out one Pip, who\u2019s now been missing long: I think\nhe\u2019s in those far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he\nmust be very sad; for look! he\u2019s left his tambourine behind;\u2014I found\nit. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I\u2019ll beat ye your\ndying march.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have heard,\u201d murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, \u201cthat in\nviolent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and\nthat when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their\nwholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken\nin their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor\nPip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers\nof all our heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?\u2014Hark! he\nspeaks again: but more wildly now.\u201d\n\n\u201cForm two and two! Let\u2019s make a General of him! Ho, where\u2019s his\nharpoon? Lay it across here.\u2014Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game\ncock now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!\u2014mind ye\nthat; Queequeg dies game!\u2014take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies\ngame! I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward;\ndied all a\u2019shiver;\u2014out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the\nAntilles he\u2019s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he\njumped from a whale-boat!
