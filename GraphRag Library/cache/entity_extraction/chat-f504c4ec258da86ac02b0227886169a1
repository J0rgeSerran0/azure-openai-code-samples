Oh, ye stars! he sat up\nwith me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher,\nand very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh\nout! why don\u2019t ye? You know you\u2019re a precious jolly rascal.)

But\nI may as well say\u2014en passant, as the French remark\u2014that I myself\u2014that\nis to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy\u2014am a strict total\nabstinence man; I never drink\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWater!\u201d cried the captain; \u201che never drinks it; it\u2019s a sort of fits to\nhim; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on\u2014go on with\nthe arm story.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I may as well,\u201d said the surgeon, coolly. \u201cI was about observing,\nsir, before Captain Boomer\u2019s facetious interruption, that spite of my\nbest and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse;\nthe truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw;\nmore than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead\nline. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it\ncame. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is\nagainst all rule\u201d\u2014pointing at it with the marlingspike\u2014\u201cthat is the\ncaptain\u2019s work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had\nthat club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one\u2019s brains out\nwith, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical\npassions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir\u201d\u2014removing his hat, and\nbrushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull,\nbut which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever\nhaving been a wound\u2014\u201cWell, the captain there will tell you how that\ncame here; he knows.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d said the captain, \u201cbut his mother did; he was born with\nit. Oh, you solemn rogue, you\u2014you Bunger! was there ever such another\nBunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in\npickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat became of the White Whale?\u201d now cried Ahab, who thus far had been\nimpatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d cried the one-armed captain, \u201coh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we\ndidn\u2019t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I\ndidn\u2019t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,\ntill some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about\nMoby Dick\u2014as some call him\u2014and then I knew it was he.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid\u2019st thou cross his wake again?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwice.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut could not fasten?\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t want to try to: ain\u2019t one limb enough? What should I do without\nthis other arm? And I\u2019m thinking Moby Dick doesn\u2019t bite so much as he\nswallows.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d interrupted Bunger, \u201cgive him your left arm for bait to\nget the right. Do you know, gentlemen\u201d\u2014very gravely and mathematically\nbowing to each Captain in succession\u2014\u201cDo you know, gentlemen, that the\ndigestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine\nProvidence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest\neven a man\u2019s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the\nWhite Whale\u2019s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to\nswallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But\nsometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of\nmine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a\ntime let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a\ntwelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in\nsmall tacks, d\u2019ye see. No possible way for him to digest that\njack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system.\nYes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind\nto pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial\nto the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale\nhave another chance at you shortly, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank ye, Bunger,\u201d said the English Captain, \u201che\u2019s welcome to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
