It belongs to the pure nautical\nmathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a\nsolid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the\nsteep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both\nsides.\n\nThe lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of\noil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand\ninfiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole\nextent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great\nHeidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is\nmystically carved in front, so the whale\u2019s vast plaited forehead forms\ninnumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his\nwondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished\nwith the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun\nof the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily\nvintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure,\nlimpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found\nunalloyed in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains\nperfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon\nbegins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when\nthe first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale\u2019s\ncase generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from\nunavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and\ndribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish\nbusiness of securing what you can.\n\nI know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was\ncoated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not\npossibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like\nthe lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm\nWhale\u2019s case.\n\nIt will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale\nembraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since\u2014as\nhas been elsewhere set forth\u2014the head embraces one third of the whole\nlength of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet\nfor a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the\ndepth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a\nship\u2019s side.\n\nAs in decapitating the whale, the operator\u2019s instrument is brought\nclose to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the\nspermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest\na careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly\nlet out its invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the\nhead, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in\nthat position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen\ncombinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that\nquarter.\n\nThus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and\u2014in\nthis particular instance\u2014almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm\nWhale\u2019s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.\n\n\nCHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets.\n\nNimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect\nposture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the\npart where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried\nwith him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,\ntravelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that\nit hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it\nis caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down\nthe other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he\nlands on the summit of the head. There\u2014still high elevated above the\nrest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries\u2014he seems some Turkish\nMuezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A\nshort-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches\nfor the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business\nhe proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,\nsounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time\nthis cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like\na well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the\nother end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or\nthree alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the\nIndian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.\nInserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the\nbucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word\nto the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like\na dairy-maid\u2019s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the\nfull-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
