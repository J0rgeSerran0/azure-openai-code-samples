To neither love nor\nreverence wilt thou be kind; and e\u2019en for hate thou canst but kill; and\nall are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless,\nplaceless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will\ndispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of\nthe personified impersonal, a personality stands here. Though but a\npoint at best; whencesoe\u2019er I came; wheresoe\u2019er I go; yet while I\nearthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and feels her royal\nrights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come in thy lowest form of\nlove, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere\nsupernal power; and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted\nworlds, there\u2019s that in here that still remains indifferent. Oh, thou\nclear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of\nfire, I breathe it back to thee.\u201d\n\n[_Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap\nlengthwise to thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes\nhis eyes, his right hand pressed hard upon them._]\n\n\u201cI own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so?

I would not take it. The\nlightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my\nwhole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning\nground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though\nthou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of\nlight, leaping out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not?\nThere burn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my\ngenealogy. But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know\nnot. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but\nthine is greater. Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself\nunbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself\nunbegun. I know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou\nomnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear\nspirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness\nmechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly\nsee it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast\nthy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief.

As the silent harpoon burned there\nlike a serpent\u2019s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm\u2014\u201cGod, God is\nagainst thee, old man; forbear! \u2019tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill\ncontinued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a\nfair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.\u201d\n\nOverhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the\nbraces\u2014though not a sail was left aloft.
