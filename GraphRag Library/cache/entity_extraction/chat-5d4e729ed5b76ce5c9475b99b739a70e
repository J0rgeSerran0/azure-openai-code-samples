It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats\nin those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them\nin the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of\nmarching regiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that\nhad been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first\ndescried; and whether it was that Ahab\u2019s crew were all such\ntiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the\nsenses of the sharks\u2014a matter sometimes well known to affect\nthem,\u2014however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without\nmolesting the others.\n\n\u201cHeart of wrought steel!\u201d murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and\nfollowing with his eyes the receding boat\u2014\u201ccanst thou yet ring boldly\nto that sight?\u2014lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by\nthem, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?\u2014For\nwhen three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be\nsure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the\nevening and the end of that thing\u2014be that end what it may.

A low rumbling sound was heard; a\nsubterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with\ntrailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,\nbut obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist,\nit hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping\nback into the deep.
