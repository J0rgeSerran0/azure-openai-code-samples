The three hundredth lay, I say.\u201d\n\nBildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\n\u201cCaptain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the\nduty thou owest to the other owners of this ship\u2014widows and orphans,\nmany of them\u2014and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this\nyoung man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those\norphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.\u201d\n\n\u201cThou Bildad!\u201d roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\ncabin. \u201cBlast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these\nmatters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be\nheavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape\nHorn.\u201d\n\n\u201cCaptain Peleg,\u201d said Bildad steadily, \u201cthy conscience may be drawing\nten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can\u2019t tell; but as thou art\nstill an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\nconscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering\ndown to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\u201d\n\n\u201cFiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye\ninsult me. It\u2019s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that\nhe\u2019s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me,\nand start my soul-bolts, but I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll\u2014yes, I\u2019ll swallow a live goat\nwith all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,\ndrab-coloured son of a wooden gun\u2014a straight wake with ye!\u201d\n\nAs he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\nmarvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\n\nAlarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\nresponsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all\nidea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\ncommanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,\nI made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened\nwrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the\ntransom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of\nwithdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As\nfor Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more\nleft in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a\nlittle as if still nervously agitated. \u201cWhew!\u201d he whistled at last\u2014\u201cthe\nsquall\u2019s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at\nsharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs\nthe grindstone. That\u2019s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,\nIshmael\u2019s thy name, didn\u2019t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,\nfor the three hundredth lay.\u201d\n\n\u201cCaptain Peleg,\u201d said I, \u201cI have a friend with me who wants to ship\ntoo\u2014shall I bring him down to-morrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be sure,\u201d said Peleg. \u201cFetch him along, and we\u2019ll look at him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat lay does he want?\u201d groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in\nwhich he had again been burying himself.\n\n\u201cOh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\u201d said Peleg. \u201cHas he ever\nwhaled it any?\u201d turning to me.\n\n\u201cKilled more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, bring him along then.\u201d\n\nAnd, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I\nhad done a good morning\u2019s work, and that the Pequod was the identical\nship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.\n\nBut I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\nCaptain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\nindeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and\nreceive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by\narriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged,\nand the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the\ncaptain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he\ndoes not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to\nthe owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to\nhave a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his\nhands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain\nAhab was to be found.\n\n\u201cAnd what dost thou want of Captain\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
