Kill?\nThe Lord be merciful to his ghost! What\u2019s that noise there? You, young\nman, avast there!\u201d\n\nAnd running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force\nopen the door.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t allow it; I won\u2019t have my premises spoiled. Go for the\nlocksmith, there\u2019s one about a mile from here. But avast!\u201d putting her\nhand in her side-pocket, \u201chere\u2019s a key that\u2019ll fit, I guess; let\u2019s\nsee.\u201d And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg\u2019s\nsupplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.\n\n\u201cHave to burst it open,\u201d said I, and was running down the entry a\nlittle, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing\nI should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a\nsudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.\n\nWith a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming\nagainst the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good\nheavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right\nin the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on\ntop of his head. He looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat\nlike a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.\n\n\u201cQueequeg,\u201d said I, going up to him, \u201cQueequeg, what\u2019s the matter with\nyou?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe hain\u2019t been a sittin\u2019 so all day, has he?\u201d said the landlady.\n\nBut all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt\nlike pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost\nintolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;\nespecially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of\neight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.\n\n\u201cMrs. Hussey,\u201d said I, \u201che\u2019s _alive_ at all events; so leave us, if you\nplease, and I will see to this strange affair myself.\u201d\n\nClosing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon\nQueequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could\ndo\u2014for all my polite arts and blandishments\u2014he would not move a peg,\nnor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in\nthe slightest way.\n\nI wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do\nthey fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so;\nyes, it\u2019s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he\u2019ll\nget up sooner or later, no doubt. It can\u2019t last for ever, thank God,\nand his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s very\npunctual then.\n\nI went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long\nstories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage,\nas they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or\nbrig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only);\nafter listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o\u2019clock, I\nwent up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg\nmust certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there\nhe was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began\nto grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to\nbe sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,\nholding a piece of wood on his head.\n\n\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and\nhave some supper. You\u2019ll starve; you\u2019ll kill yourself, Queequeg.\u201d But\nnot a word did he reply.\n\nDespairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\nand no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to\nturning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as\nit promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his\nordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not\nget into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere\nthought of Queequeg\u2014not four feet off\u2014sitting there in that uneasy\nposition, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really\nwretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide\nawake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\n\nBut somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\nday; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he\nhad been screwed down to the floor.
