This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one\nof the larger vertebr\u00e6, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer\nconvex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call\nthis high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm\nWhale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have\nreason to know.\n\n\nCHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.\n\nThe predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau,\nDerick De Deer, master, of Bremen.\n\nAt one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and\nGermans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide\nintervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with\ntheir flag in the Pacific.\n\nFor some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.\nWhile yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a\nboat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the\nbows instead of the stern.\n\n\u201cWhat has he in his hand there?\u201d cried Starbuck, pointing to something\nwavingly held by the German. \u201cImpossible!\u2014a lamp-feeder!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that,\u201d said Stubb, \u201cno, no, it\u2019s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he\u2019s\ncoming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don\u2019t you see that big\ntin can there alongside of him?\u2014that\u2019s his boiling water. Oh! he\u2019s all\nright, is the Yarman.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo along with you,\u201d cried Flask, \u201cit\u2019s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.\nHe\u2019s out of oil, and has come a-begging.\u201d\n\nHowever curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the\nwhale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old\nproverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing\nreally happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did\nindubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.\n\nAs he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all\nheeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German\nsoon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately\nturning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some\nremarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in\nprofound darkness\u2014his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a\nsingle flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by\nhinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically\ncalled a _clean_ one (that is, an empty one), well deserving the name\nof Jungfrau or the Virgin.\n\nHis necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his\nship\u2019s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the\nmast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that\nwithout pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed\nround his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.\n\nNow, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German\nboats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the\nPequod\u2019s keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their\ndanger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight before\nthe wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in\nharness. They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling\na great wide parchment upon the sea.\n\nFull in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,\nhumped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as\nby the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed\nafflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this\nwhale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is\nnot customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.\nNevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water\nmust have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad\nmuzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile\ncurrents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth\nwith a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds,\nfollowed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to\nhave egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind\nhim to upbubble.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s got some paregoric?\u201d said Stubb, \u201che has the stomach-ache, I\u2019m\nafraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse\nwinds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It\u2019s the first foul wind\nI ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so\nbefore? it must be, he\u2019s lost his tiller.\u201d\n\nAs an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck\nload of frightened horses, care\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
