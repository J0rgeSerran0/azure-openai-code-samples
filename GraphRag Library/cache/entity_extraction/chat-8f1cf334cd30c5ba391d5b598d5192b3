At one time she would come on board with a\njar of pickles for the steward\u2019s pantry; another time with a bunch of\nquills for the chief mate\u2019s desk, where he kept his log; a third time\nwith a roll of flannel for the small of some one\u2019s rheumatic back.\nNever did any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity\u2014Aunt\nCharity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this\ncharitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn\nher hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort,\nand consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother\nBildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of\nwell-saved dollars.\n\nBut it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on\nboard, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and\na still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor\nCaptain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him\na long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down\nwent his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a\nwhile Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men\ndown the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and\nthen concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.\n\nDuring these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the\ncraft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and\nwhen he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they\nwould answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected\naboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could\nattend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I\nhad been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly\nin my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so\nlong a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the\nabsolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open\nsea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he\nbe already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up\nhis suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I\nsaid nothing, and tried to think nothing.\n\nAt last it was given out that some time next day the ship would\ncertainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early\nstart.\n\n\nCHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.\n\nIt was nearly six o\u2019clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we\ndrew nigh the wharf.\n\n\u201cThere are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,\u201d said I to\nQueequeg, \u201cit can\u2019t be shadows; she\u2019s off by sunrise, I guess; come\non!\u201d\n\n\u201cAvast!\u201d cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close\nbehind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating\nhimself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain\ntwilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.\n\n\u201cGoing aboard?\u201d\n\n\u201cHands off, will you,\u201d said I.\n\n\u201cLookee here,\u201d said Queequeg, shaking himself, \u201cgo \u2019way!\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t going aboard, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we are,\u201d said I, \u201cbut what business is that of yours? Do you\nknow, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no; I wasn\u2019t aware of that,\u201d said Elijah, slowly and\nwonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable\nglances.\n\n\u201cElijah,\u201d said I, \u201cyou will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We\nare going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be\ndetained.\u201d\n\n\u201cYe be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s cracked, Queequeg,\u201d said I, \u201ccome on.\u201d\n\n\u201cHolloa!\u201d cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few\npaces.\n\n\u201cNever mind him,\u201d said I, \u201cQueequeg, come on.\u201d\n\nBut he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my\nshoulder, said\u2014\u201cDid ye see anything looking like men going towards that\nship a while ago?\u201d\n\nStruck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, \u201cYes,\nI thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery dim, very dim,\u201d said Elijah. \u201cMorning to ye.\u201d\n\nOnce more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and\ntouching my shoulder again, said, \u201cSee if you can find \u2019em now, will\nye?\n\n\u201cFind who?\u201d\n\n\u201cMorning to ye! morning to ye!\u201d he rejoined, again moving off. \u201cOh!
