And it is much to be\ndeplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion\nof the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of\nanything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a\ncomfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,\na hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small\nand snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your\nmost usual point of perch is the head of the t\u2019 gallant-mast, where you\nstand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)\ncalled the t\u2019 gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the\nbeginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull\u2019s horns. To\nbe sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in\nthe shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest\nwatch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul\nis glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about\nin it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing\n(like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a\nwatch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or\nadditional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of\ndrawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of\nyour watch-coat.\n\nConcerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a\nsouthern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or\npulpits, called _crow\u2019s-nests_, in which the look-outs of a Greenland\nwhaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In\nthe fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled \u201cA Voyage among the\nIcebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the\nre-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;\u201d in this\nadmirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a\ncharmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\n_crow\u2019s-nest_ of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet\u2019s\ngood craft. He called it the _Sleet\u2019s crow\u2019s-nest_, in honor of\nhimself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all\nridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children\nafter our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and\npatentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other\napparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet\u2019s crow\u2019s-nest is something\nlike a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is\nfurnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head\nin a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into\nit through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or\nside next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker\nunderneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather\nrack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and\nother nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his\nmast-head in this crow\u2019s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a\nrifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask\nand shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or\nvagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot\nsuccessfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the\nwater, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it\nwas plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does,\nall the little detailed conveniences of his crow\u2019s-nest; but though he\nso enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very\nscientific account of his experiments in this crow\u2019s-nest, with a small\ncompass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors\nresulting from what is called the \u201clocal attraction\u201d of all binnacle\nmagnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in\nthe ship\u2019s planks, and in the Glacier\u2019s case, perhaps, to there having\nbeen so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though\nthe Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his\nlearned \u201cbinnacle deviations,\u201d \u201cazimuth compass observations,\u201d and\n\u201capproximate errors,\u201d he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was\nnot so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail\nbeing attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little\ncase-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow\u2019s nest, within\neasy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and\neven love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it\nvery ill of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
