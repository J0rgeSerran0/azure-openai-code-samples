Presently, after many hasty snatches into the\nfire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed\nto be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the\nbiscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite\noffer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to\nfancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these\nstrange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from\nthe devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing\nsome pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in\nthe most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the\nidol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket\nas carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing\nhim now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\noperations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\nnow or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which\nI had so long been bound.\n\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\nTaking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for\nan instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the\nhandle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment\nthe light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between\nhis teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it\nnow; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.\n\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\nagainst the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\nbe, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his\nguttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my\nmeaning.\n\n\u201cWho-e debel you?\u201d\u2014he at last said\u2014\u201cyou no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.\u201d\nAnd so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the\ndark.\n\n\u201cLandlord, for God\u2019s sake, Peter Coffin!\u201d shouted I. \u201cLandlord!

He really did this in not only a\ncivil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a\nmoment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\nlooking cannibal. What\u2019s all this fuss I have been making about,\nthought I to myself\u2014the man\u2019s a human being just as I am: he has just\nas much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.

Besides, I ain\u2019t insured.\u201d\n\nThis being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\nmotioned me to get into bed\u2014rolling over to one side as much as to\nsay\u2014\u201cI won\u2019t touch a leg of ye.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood night, landlord,\u201d said I, \u201cyou may go.\u201d\n\nI turned in, and never slept better in my life.\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.
