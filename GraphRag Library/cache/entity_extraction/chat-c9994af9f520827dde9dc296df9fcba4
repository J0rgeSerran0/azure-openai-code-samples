Can\u2019st thou smoothe this seam?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for\nthough thou only see\u2019st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into\nthe bone of my skull\u2014_that_ is all wrinkles! But, away with child\u2019s\nplay; no more gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!\u201d jingling the\nleathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. \u201cI, too, want a harpoon\nmade; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth;\nsomething that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. There\u2019s the\nstuff,\u201d flinging the pouch upon the anvil. \u201cLook ye, blacksmith, these\nare the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.\u201d\n\n\u201cHorse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the\nbest and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the\nmelted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me\nfirst, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer\nthese twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick!\nI\u2019ll blow the fire.\u201d\n\nWhen at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by\nspiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. \u201cA\nflaw!\u201d rejecting the last one. \u201cWork that over again, Perth.\u201d\n\nThis done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when\nAhab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then,\nwith regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to\nhim the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge\nshooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and\nbowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or\nsome blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?\u201d muttered\nStubb, looking on from the forecastle. \u201cThat Parsee smells fire like a\nfusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket\u2019s powder-pan.\u201d\n\nAt last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as\nPerth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near\nby, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab\u2019s bent face.\n\n\u201cWould\u2019st thou brand me, Perth?\u201d wincing for a moment with the pain;\n\u201chave I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cPray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this\nharpoon for the White Whale?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them\nthyself, man. Here are my razors\u2014the best of steel; here, and make the\nbarbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would\nfain not use them.\n\n\u201cTake them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup,\nnor pray till\u2014but here\u2014to work!\u201d\n\nFashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the\nshank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the\nblacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to\ntempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.\n\n\u201cNo, no\u2014no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,\nthere! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me\nas much blood as will cover this barb?\u201d holding it high up. A cluster\nof dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen\nflesh, and the White Whale\u2019s barbs were then tempered.\n\n\u201cEgo non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!\u201d\ndeliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the\nbaptismal blood.\n\nNow, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of\nhickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the\nsocket of the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some\nfathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension.\nPressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string,\nthen eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed,\n\u201cGood! and now for the seizings.\u201d\n\nAt one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns\nwere all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole\nwas then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
