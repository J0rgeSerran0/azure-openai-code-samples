The Pipe.\n\nWhen Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the\nbulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a\nsailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also\nhis pipe. Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool\non the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.\n\nIn old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were\nfabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could\none look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without\nbethinking him of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank,\nand a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.\n\nSome moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth\nin quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. \u201cHow\nnow,\u201d he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, \u201cthis smoking no\nlonger soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be\ngone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring\u2014aye, and\nignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with\nsuch nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were\nthe strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this\npipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white\nvapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like\nmine. I\u2019ll smoke no more\u2014\u201d\n\nHe tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the\nwaves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe\nmade.

You know the old man\u2019s\nivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to\nkick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And\nthen, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept\nkicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask\u2014you know how\ncurious all dreams are\u2014through all this rage that I was in, I somehow\nseemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an\ninsult, that kick from Ahab. \u2018Why,\u2019 thinks I, \u2018what\u2019s the row? It\u2019s not\na real leg, only a false leg.\u2019 And there\u2019s a mighty difference between\na living thump and a dead thump.

Besides,\u2019 thinks I, \u2018look at it once; why, the end of it\u2014the\nfoot part\u2014what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed\nfarmer kicked me, _there\u2019s_ a devilish broad insult.
