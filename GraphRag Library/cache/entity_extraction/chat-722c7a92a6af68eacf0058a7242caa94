All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so\nhas the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the\ncaptain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern\nsheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often\nsteers himself with a pretty little milliner\u2019s tiller decorated with\ngay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa\nof that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if\nwhaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old\naldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never\nadmits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete\nboat\u2019s crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or\nharpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the\noccasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to\nhis visit all standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that\nbeing conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him\nfrom the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to\nthe importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor\nis this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting\nsteering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the\nafter-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus\ncompletely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself\nsideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent\npitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of\nfoundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a\nspread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again,\nit would never do in plain sight of the world\u2019s riveted eyes, it would\nnever do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying\nhimself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his\nhands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he\ngenerally carries his hands in his trowsers\u2019 pockets; but perhaps being\ngenerally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast.\nNevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones\ntoo, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment\nor two, in a sudden squall say\u2014to seize hold of the nearest oarsman\u2019s\nhair, and hold on there like grim death.\n\n\nCHAPTER 54. The Town-Ho\u2019s Story.\n\n(_As told at the Golden Inn._)\n\nThe Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is\nmuch like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet\nmore travellers than in any other part.\n\nIt was not very long after speaking the Goney that another\nhomeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned\nalmost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us\nstrong news of Moby Dick. To some the general interest in the White\nWhale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho\u2019s\nstory, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain\nwondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of\nGod which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter\ncircumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may\nbe called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never\nreached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of\nthe story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the\nprivate property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of\nwhom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of\nsecrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and\nrevealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could\nnot well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did\nthis thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full\nknowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were\nthey governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among\nthemselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod\u2019s main-mast.\nInterweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as\npublicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now\nproceed to put on lasting record.\n\n*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,\nstill used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.\n\nFor my humor\u2019s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once\nnarrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one\nsaint\u2019s eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden\nInn. Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were\non the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they\noccasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.\n\n\u201c\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
