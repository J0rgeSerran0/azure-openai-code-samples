Now I don\u2019t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he\nwears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he\nwon\u2019t put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with\nthat coffin? And now I\u2019m ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It\u2019s like\nturning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I\ndon\u2019t like this cobbling sort of business\u2014I don\u2019t like it at all; it\u2019s\nundignified; it\u2019s not my place. Let tinkers\u2019 brats do tinkerings; we\nare their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin,\nfair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at\nthe beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at\nthe conclusion; not a cobbler\u2019s job, that\u2019s at an end in the middle,\nand at the beginning at the end. It\u2019s the old woman\u2019s tricks to be\ngiving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women have for\ntinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a\nbald-headed young tinker once. And that\u2019s the reason I never would work\nfor lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the\nVineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run\noff with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let\nme see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with\npitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over\nthe ship\u2019s stern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some\nsuperstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere\nthey would do the job. But I\u2019m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I\ndon\u2019t budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard\ntray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and\ncard-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or\nby the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore\nof our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it\nif we can. Hem! I\u2019ll do the job, now, tenderly. I\u2019ll have me\u2014let\u2019s\nsee\u2014how many in the ship\u2019s company, all told? But I\u2019ve forgotten. Any\nway, I\u2019ll have me thirty separate, Turk\u2019s-headed life-lines, each three\nfeet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down,\nthere\u2019ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight\nnot seen very often beneath the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron,\npitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let\u2019s to it.\u201d\n\n\nCHAPTER 127.
