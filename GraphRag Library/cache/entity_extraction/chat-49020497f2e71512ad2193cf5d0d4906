The vast swells of the\nomnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled\nalong the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless\nbowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip\nfor an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost\nseemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the\nwatery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the\ntop of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other\nside;\u2014all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and\nthe shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the\nivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like\na wild hen after her screaming brood;\u2014all this was thrilling.\n\nNot the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever\nheat of his first battle; not the dead man\u2019s ghost encountering the\nfirst unknown phantom in the other world;\u2014neither of these can feel\nstranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first\ntime finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the\nhunted sperm whale.\n\nThe dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and\nmore visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows\nflung upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted\neverywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes.\nThe boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales\nrunning dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still\nrising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through\nthe water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to\nescape being torn from the row-locks.\n\nSoon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither\nship nor boat to be seen.\n\n\u201cGive way, men,\u201d whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the\nsheet of his sail; \u201cthere is time to kill a fish yet before the squall\ncomes. There\u2019s white water again!\u2014close to! Spring!\u201d\n\nSoon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted\nthat the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when\nwith a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: \u201cStand up!\u201d and\nQueequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.\n\nThough not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril\nso close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance\nof the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent\ninstant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of\nfifty elephants stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still\nbooming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like\nthe erected crests of enraged serpents.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s his hump. _There_, _there_, give it to him!\u201d whispered\nStarbuck.\n\nA short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of\nQueequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from\nastern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail\ncollapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;\nsomething rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole\ncrew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the\nwhite curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all\nblended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.\n\nThough completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round\nit we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,\ntumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea,\nthe water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing\neyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the\nbottom of the ocean.\n\nThe wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;\nthe whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white\nfire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal\nin these jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar\nto the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those\nboats in that storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew\ndarker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.\nThe rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were\nuseless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers.\nSo, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many\nfailures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then\nstretching it on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the\nstandard-bearer of this forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up\nthat imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness. There,\nthen, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly\nholding\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
