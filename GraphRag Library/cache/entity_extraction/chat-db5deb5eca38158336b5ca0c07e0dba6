I\u2019m a sort of\nstrange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that\u2019s only haphazard-like.\nThen, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade\nout into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks\nyou under the chin pretty quick, and there\u2019s a great cry for\nlife-boats. And here\u2019s the heron\u2019s leg! long and slim, sure enough!\nNow, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be\nbecause they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her\nroly-poly old coach-horses.

Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.\n\nAccording to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no\ninconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have\nsprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into\nthe cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*\n\n*In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it\nis a regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and\ndrench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying\nintervals, is removed by the ship\u2019s pumps. Hereby the casks are sought\nto be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the\nwithdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the\nprecious cargo.\n\nNow, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and\nthe Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from\nthe China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with a\ngeneral chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him; and\nanother separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the\nJapanese islands\u2014Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new\nivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a long\npruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man, with\nhis back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and tracing his\nold courses again.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning round\nto it. \u201cOn deck! Begone!\u201d\n\n\u201cCaptain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir.\nWe must up Burtons and break out.\u201d\n\n\u201cUp Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here\nfor a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?\u201d\n\n\u201cEither do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make\ngood in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth\nsaving, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it is, so it is; if we get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it\nleak! I\u2019m all aleak myself.
