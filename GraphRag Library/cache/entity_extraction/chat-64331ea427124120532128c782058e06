There, then, he sat, holding up\nthat imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness. There,\nthen, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly\nholding up hope in the midst of despair.\n\nWet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat,\nwe lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over\nthe sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.\nSuddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear.\nWe all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled\nby the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were\ndimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the\nsea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us\nwithin a distance of not much more than its length.\n\nFloating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it\ntossed and gaped beneath the ship\u2019s bows like a chip at the base of a\ncataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no\nmore till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were\ndashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely\nlanded on board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut\nloose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship\nhad given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon\nsome token of our perishing,\u2014an oar or a lance pole.\n\n\nCHAPTER 49. The Hyena.\n\nThere are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed\naffair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast\npractical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more\nthan suspects that the joke is at nobody\u2019s expense but his own.\nHowever, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He\nbolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all\nhard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich\nof potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for\nsmall difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril\nof life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,\ngood-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen\nand unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am\nspeaking of, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation;\nit comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before\nmight have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part\nof the general joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to\nbreed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with\nit I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White\nWhale its object.\n\n\u201cQueequeg,\u201d said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the\ndeck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the\nwater; \u201cQueequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often\nhappen?\u201d Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he\ngave me to understand that such things did often happen.\n\n\u201cMr. Stubb,\u201d said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his\noil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; \u201cMr. Stubb, I\nthink I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief\nmate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose\nthen, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy\nsquall is the height of a whaleman\u2019s discretion?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertain. I\u2019ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off\nCape Horn.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Flask,\u201d said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing\nclose by; \u201cyou are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you\ntell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask,\nfor an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into\ndeath\u2019s jaws?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you twist that smaller?\u201d said Flask. \u201cYes, that\u2019s the law. I\nshould like to see a boat\u2019s crew backing water up to a whale face\nforemost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind\nthat!\u201d\n\nHere then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement\nof the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings\nin the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of\ncommon occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the\nsuperlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign\nmy life into the hands of him who steered the boat\u2014oftentimes a fellow\nwho at that very moment is in his imp\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
