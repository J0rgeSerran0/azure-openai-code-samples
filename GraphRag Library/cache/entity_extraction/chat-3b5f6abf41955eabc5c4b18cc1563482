The ship itself,\nthen, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate\nmeans of overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her,\nand were soon swayed up to their cranes\u2014the two parts of the wrecked\nboat having been previously secured by her\u2014and then hoisting everything\nto her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways\noutstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an\nalbatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At\nthe well known, methodic intervals, the whale\u2019s glittering spout was\nregularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be\nreported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing\nthe deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the\nallotted hour expired, his voice was heard.\u2014\u201cWhose is the doubloon now?\nD\u2019ye see him?\u201d and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded\nthem to lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now\naloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.\n\nAs he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men\naloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a\nstill greater breadth\u2014thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat,\nat every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped\nupon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered\nstern. At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded\nsky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old\nman\u2019s face there now stole some such added gloom as this.\n\nStubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to\nevince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in\nhis Captain\u2019s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed\u2014\u201cThe\nthistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did\nI not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could\nswear thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a\nwreck.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, sir,\u201d said Starbuck drawing near, \u201c\u2019tis a solemn sight; an omen,\nand an ill one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOmen? omen?\u2014the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to\nman, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and\ngive an old wives\u2019 darkling hint.\u2014Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles\nof one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye\ntwo are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the\npeopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold\u2014I shiver!\u2014How\nnow? Aloft there! D\u2019ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he\nspout ten times a second!\u201d\n\nThe day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.\nSoon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t see the spout now, sir;\u2014too dark\u201d\u2014cried a voice from the air.\n\n\u201cHow heading when last seen?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs before, sir,\u2014straight to leeward.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood! he will travel slower now \u2019tis night. Down royals and\ntop-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before\nmorning; he\u2019s making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm\nthere! keep her full before the wind!\u2014Aloft! come down!\u2014Mr. Stubb, send\na fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till\nmorning.\u201d\u2014Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast\u2014\u201cMen,\nthis gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till\nthe White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him,\nupon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man\u2019s; and if on\nthat day I shall again raise him, then, ten times its sum shall be\ndivided among all of ye! Away now!\u2014the deck is thine, sir!\u201d\n\nAnd so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and\nslouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals\nrousing himself to see how the night wore on.\n\n\nCHAPTER 134.
