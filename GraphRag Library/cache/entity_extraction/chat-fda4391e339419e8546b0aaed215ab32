The Carpenter.\n\nSeat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high\nabstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But\nfrom the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they\nseem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.\nBut most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of\nthe high, humane abstraction; the Pequod\u2019s carpenter was no duplicate;\nhence, he now comes in person on this stage.\n\nLike all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging\nto whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent,\nalike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his\nown; the carpenter\u2019s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk\nof all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with\nwood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of\nthe generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly\nefficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually\nrecurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years\u2019 voyage, in\nuncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in\nordinary duties:\u2014repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the\nshape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull\u2019s eyes in the deck, or new\ntree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more\ndirectly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover\nunhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both\nuseful and capricious.\n\nThe one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,\nwas his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several\nvices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times\nexcept when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed\nathwartships against the rear of the Try-works.\n\nA belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:\nthe carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and\nstraightway files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage\nstrays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of\nright-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter\nmakes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the\ncarpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars\nto be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his\nbig vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the\nconstellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the\ncarpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out\npincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there;\nbut the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded\noperation; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter\nsigns him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.\n\nThus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent\nand without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he\ndeemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But\nwhile now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with\nsuch liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue\nsome uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For\nnothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal\nstolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the\nsurrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general\nstolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while\npauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace,\nand ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was\nthis half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an\nall-ramifying heartlessness;\u2014yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an\nold, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked\nnow and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have\nserved to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded\nforecastle of Noah\u2019s ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a\nlife-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had\ngathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small\noutward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a\nstript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born\nbabe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.\nYou might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him\ninvolved a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did\nnot seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he\nhad been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or\nuneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
