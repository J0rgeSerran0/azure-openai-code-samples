(_Octavo_).\n\nOCTAVOES.*\u2014These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which\npresent may be numbered:\u2014I., the _Grampus_; II., the _Black Fish_;\nIII., the _Narwhale_; IV., the _Thrasher_; V., the _Killer_.\n\n*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.\nBecause, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of\nthe former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them\nin figure, yet the bookbinder\u2019s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form\ndoes not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume\ndoes.\n\nBOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER I. (_Grampus_).\u2014Though this fish, whose\nloud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to\nlandsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not\npopularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand\ndistinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised\nhim for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to\ntwenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the\nwaist. He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil\nis considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some\nfishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the\ngreat sperm whale.\n\nBOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER II. (_Black Fish_).\u2014I give the popular\nfishermen\u2019s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.\nWhere any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and\nsuggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called,\nbecause blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the\nHyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the\ncircumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he\ncarries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale\naverages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost\nall latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin\nin swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more\nprofitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the\nHyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic\nemployment\u2014as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and\nquite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.\nThough their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you\nupwards of thirty gallons of oil.\n\nBOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER III. (_Narwhale_), that is, _Nostril\nwhale_.\u2014Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose\nfrom his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The\ncreature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five\nfeet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly\nspeaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw\nin a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found\non the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner\nsomething analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What\nprecise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to\nsay. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and\nbill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for\na rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin\nsaid it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the\nsurface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his\nhorn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these\nsurmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided\nhorn may really be used by the Narwhale\u2014however that may be\u2014it would\ncertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.\nThe Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale,\nand the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the\nUnicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From\ncertain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same\nsea-unicorn\u2019s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote\nagainst poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.\nIt was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same\nway that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.\nOriginally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity.\nBlack Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that\nvoyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him\nfrom a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the\nThames; \u201cwhen Sir Martin returned from that voyage,\u201d saith Black\nLetter, \u201con bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long\nhorn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle\nat Windsor.\u201d An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on\nbended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn,\npertaining to a land beast of the unicorn\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
