Besides,\u2019 thinks I, \u2018look at it once; why, the end of it\u2014the\nfoot part\u2014what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed\nfarmer kicked me, _there\u2019s_ a devilish broad insult. But this insult is\nwhittled down to a point only.\u2019 But now comes the greatest joke of the\ndream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of\nbadger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the\nshoulders, and slews me round. \u2018What are you \u2019bout?\u2019 says he. Slid!\nman, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was\nover the fright. \u2018What am I about?\u2019 says I at last. \u2018And what business\nis that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do _you_ want a\nkick?\u2019 By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned\nround his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he\nhad for a clout\u2014what do you think, I saw?\u2014why thunder alive, man, his\nstern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on\nsecond thoughts, \u2018I guess I won\u2019t kick you, old fellow.\u2019 \u2018Wise Stubb,\u2019\nsaid he, \u2018wise Stubb;\u2019 and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of\neating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn\u2019t going to\nstop saying over his \u2018wise Stubb, wise Stubb,\u2019 I thought I might as\nwell fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my\nfoot for it, when he roared out, \u2018Stop that kicking!\u2019 \u2018Halloa,\u2019 says I,\n\u2018what\u2019s the matter now, old fellow?\u2019 \u2018Look ye here,\u2019 says he; \u2018let\u2019s\nargue the insult.

Didn\u2019t he kick with right good\nwill? it wasn\u2019t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you\nwere kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It\u2019s\nan honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England\nthe greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and\nmade garter-knights of; but, be _your_ boast, Stubb, that ye were\nkicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; _be_\nkicked by him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back;\nfor you can\u2019t help yourself, wise Stubb. Don\u2019t you see that pyramid?\u2019\nWith that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to\nswim off into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my\nhammock! Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMay be; may be. But it\u2019s made a wise man of me, Flask. D\u2019ye see Ahab\nstanding there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing\nyou can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him,\nwhatever he says. Halloa! What\u2019s that he shouts? Hark!\u201d\n\n\u201cMast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!\n\n\u201cIf ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!\n\n\u201cWhat do you think of that now, Flask? ain\u2019t there a small drop of\nsomething queer about that, eh? A white whale\u2014did ye mark that, man?\nLook ye\u2014there\u2019s something special in the wind. Stand by for it, Flask.\nAhab has that that\u2019s bloody on his mind.
