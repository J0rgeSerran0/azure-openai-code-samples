It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he\nseemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits\nwere more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. \u201cIt feels\nlike going down into one\u2019s tomb,\u201d\u2014he would mutter to himself\u2014\u201cfor an\nold captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my\ngrave-dug berth.\u201d\n\nSo, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were\nset, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;\nand when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors\nflung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt\nit to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when\nthis sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the\nsilent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old\nman would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled\nway. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like\nthese, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because\nto his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory\nheel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony\nstep, that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of\nsharks. But once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings;\nand as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from\ntaffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below,\nwith a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if\nCaptain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say\nnay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting\nsomething indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the\ninsertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know\nAhab then.\n\n\u201cAm I a cannon-ball, Stubb,\u201d said Ahab, \u201cthat thou wouldst wad me that\nfashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave;\nwhere such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at\nlast.\u2014Down, dog, and kennel!\u201d\n\nStarting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly\nscornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,\n\u201cI am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half\nlike it, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAvast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away,\nas if to avoid some passionate temptation.\n\n\u201cNo, sir; not yet,\u201d said Stubb, emboldened, \u201cI will not tamely be\ncalled a dog, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone,\nor I\u2019ll clear the world of thee!\u201d\n\nAs he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors\nin his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.\n\n\u201cI was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,\u201d\nmuttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. \u201cIt\u2019s\nvery queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don\u2019t well know whether to go\nback and strike him, or\u2014what\u2019s that?\u2014down here on my knees and pray for\nhim? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the\nfirst time I ever _did_ pray. It\u2019s queer; very queer; and he\u2019s queer\ntoo; aye, take him fore and aft, he\u2019s about the queerest old man Stubb\never sailed with. How he flashed at me!\u2014his eyes like powder-pans! is\nhe mad? Anyway there\u2019s something on his mind, as sure as there must be\nsomething on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either,\nmore than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don\u2019t sleep then.\nDidn\u2019t that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always\nfinds the old man\u2019s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the\nsheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and\nthe pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on\nit? A hot old man! I guess he\u2019s got what some folks ashore call a\nconscience; it\u2019s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say\u2014worse nor a\ntoothache. Well, well; I don\u2019t know what it is, but the Lord keep me\nfrom catching it. He\u2019s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the\nafter hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what\u2019s\nthat for, I should like to know? Who\u2019s made appointments with him in\nthe hold? Ain\u2019t that queer, now? But there\u2019s no telling, it\u2019s the old\ngame\u2014Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it\u2019s worth a fellow\u2019s while to be\nborn into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think\nof it, that\u2019s about the first thing babies do, and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
