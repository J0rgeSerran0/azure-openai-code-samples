The Lee Shore.\n\nSome chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded\nmariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.\n\nWhen on that shivering winter\u2019s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive\nbows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her\nhelm but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon\nthe man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years\u2019 dangerous\nvoyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another\ntempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest\nthings are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs;\nthis six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only\nsay that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that\nmiserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give\nsuccor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort,\nhearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that\u2019s kind to our\nmortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship\u2019s\ndirest jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,\nthough it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and\nthrough. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing,\nfights \u2019gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks\nall the lashed sea\u2019s landlessness again; for refuge\u2019s sake forlornly\nrushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!\n\nKnow ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally\nintolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid\neffort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the\nwildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the\ntreacherous, slavish shore?\n\nBut as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,\nindefinite as God\u2014so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite,\nthan be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For\nworm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the\nterrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O\nBulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy\nocean-perishing\u2014straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!\n\n\nCHAPTER 24. The Advocate.\n\nAs Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling;\nand as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among\nlandsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I\nam all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby\ndone to us hunters of whales.\n\nIn the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish\nthe fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not\naccounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a\nstranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,\nit would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were\nhe presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation\nof the naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale\nFishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed\npre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.\n\nDoubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us\nwhalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a\nbutchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we\nare surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is\ntrue. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been\nall Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And\nas for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye\nshall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally\nunknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm\nwhale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But\neven granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered\nslippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable\ncarrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to\ndrink in all ladies\u2019 plaudits?\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
