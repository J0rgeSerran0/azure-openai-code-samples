It receives its\ndesignation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\nup-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\npitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must best\nand most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.\n\nBut soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round\nand round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful\nwake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly\nassault. The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the\nblood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus\u2019s elephants in the\nbook of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the\nwhale\u2019s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,\u2014though he\ncould still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;\nhelpless Ahab\u2019s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least\nchance shock might burst. From the boat\u2019s fragmentary stern, Fedallah\nincuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other\ndrifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to\nlook to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale\u2019s\naspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,\nthat he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other\nboats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into\nthe eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant\ndestruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that\ncase could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then,\nthey remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had\nnow become the old man\u2019s head.\n\nMeantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship\u2019s\nmast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;\nand was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!\u2014\u201cSail on\nthe\u201d\u2014but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and\nwhelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing\nto rise on a towering crest, he shouted,\u2014\u201cSail on the whale!\u2014Drive him\noff!\u201d\n\nThe Pequod\u2019s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,\nshe effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly\nswam off, the boats flew to the rescue.\n\nDragged into Stubb\u2019s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white\nbrine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab\u2019s bodily\nstrength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body\u2019s doom: for a\ntime, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb\u2019s boat, like one trodden\nunder foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from\nhim, as desolate sounds from out ravines.\n\nBut this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\nabbreviate it. In an instant\u2019s compass, great hearts sometimes condense\nto one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused\nthrough feebler men\u2019s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary\nin each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time\naggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous\nintensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures\ncontain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.\n\n\u201cThe harpoon,\u201d said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on\none bended arm\u2014\u201cis it safe?\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,\u201d said Stubb, showing it.\n\n\u201cLay it before me;\u2014any missing men?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne, two, three, four, five;\u2014there were five oars, sir, and here are\nfive men.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u2014Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him! there!\nthere! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!\u2014Hands off from me!\nThe eternal sap runs up in Ahab\u2019s bones again! Set the sail; out oars;\nthe helm!\u201d\n\nIt is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked\nup by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is\nthus continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now.\nBut the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the\nwhale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with\na velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these\ncircumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely\nprolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long\na period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing\nbarely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude.
