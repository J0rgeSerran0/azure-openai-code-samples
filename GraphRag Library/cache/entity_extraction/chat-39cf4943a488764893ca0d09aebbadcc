Nor does it\nunfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such\ntender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years\u2019 voyage\nin some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a\nwhaleman\u2019s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a\nfather\u2019s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and\nconcern.\n\nMeantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab;\nand Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without\nthe least quivering of his own.\n\n\u201cI will not go,\u201d said the stranger, \u201ctill you say _aye_ to me.

But starting from his enchantment,\nGardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his\nboat, and returned to his ship.\n\nSoon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel\nwas in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,\nhowever small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung\nround; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat\nagainst a head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the\nwhile, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three\ntall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.\n\nBut by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly\nsaw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without\ncomfort. She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were\nnot.\n\n\nCHAPTER 129.

Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most\ndesired health. Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee,\nas if thou wert the captain.
