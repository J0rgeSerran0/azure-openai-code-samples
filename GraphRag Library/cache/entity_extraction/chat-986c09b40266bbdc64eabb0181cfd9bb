But almost everybody supposed that this\nparticular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to\nthe ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his\nintention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But such a supposition\ndid by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat\u2019s crew\nbeing assigned to that boat.\n\nNow, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned\naway; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such\nunaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown\nnooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of\nwhalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway\ncreatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck,\noars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that\nBeelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin\nto chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable\nexcitement in the forecastle.\n\nBut be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate\nphantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were\nsomehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a\nmuffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like\nthis, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be\nlinked with Ahab\u2019s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort\nof a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even\nauthority over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an\nindifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as\ncivilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their\ndreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide\namong the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles\nto the east of the continent\u2014those insulated, immemorial, unalterable\ncountries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the\nghostly aboriginalness of earth\u2019s primal generations, when the memory\nof the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his\ndescendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real\nphantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and\nto what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed\nconsorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the\nuncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.\n\n\nCHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.\n\nDays, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly\nswept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off\nthe Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of\nthe Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery\nlocality, southerly from St. Helena.\n\nIt was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and\nmoonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;\nand, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery\nsilence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen\nfar in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it\nlooked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from\nthe sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight\nnights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a\nlook-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet,\nthough herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a\nhundred would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what\nemotions, then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at\nsuch unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But\nwhen, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive\nnights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence,\nhis unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet,\nevery reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit\nhad lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. \u201cThere she\nblows!\u201d Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered\nmore; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure.
