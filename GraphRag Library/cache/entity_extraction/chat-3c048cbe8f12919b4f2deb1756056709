Espied by some timid man-of-war\nor blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring\nthe swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in\nthe sun, and the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the\nwhale\u2019s unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the\nlog\u2014_shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts: beware!_ And for years\nafterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly\nsheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there\nwhen a stick was held. There\u2019s your law of precedents; there\u2019s your\nutility of traditions; there\u2019s the story of your obstinate survival of\nold beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in\nthe air! There\u2019s orthodoxy!\n\nThus, while in life the great whale\u2019s body may have been a real terror\nto his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a\nworld.\n\nAre you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than\nthe Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe\nin them.\n\n\nCHAPTER 70. The Sphynx.\n\nIt should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping\nthe body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the\nSperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced\nwhale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.\n\nConsider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck;\non the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that\nvery place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the\nsurgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening\nbetween him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a\ndiscoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear\nin mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut\nmany feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without\nso much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus\nmade, he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts,\nand exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion\ninto the skull. Do you not marvel, then, at Stubb\u2019s boast, that he\ndemanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?\n\nWhen first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a\ncable till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small\nwhale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a\nfull grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale\u2019s head\nembraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend\nsuch a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this\nwere as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers\u2019\nscales.\n\nThe Pequod\u2019s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head\nwas hoisted against the ship\u2019s side\u2014about half way out of the sea, so\nthat it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And\nthere with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of\nthe enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm\non that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that\nblood-dripping head hung to the Pequod\u2019s waist like the giant\nHolofernes\u2019s from the girdle of Judith.\n\nWhen this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went\nbelow to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but\nnow deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow\nlotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves\nupon the sea.\n\nA short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone\nfrom his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to\ngaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took\nStubb\u2019s long spade\u2014still remaining there after the whale\u2019s\ndecapitation\u2014and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended\nmass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood\nleaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.\n\nIt was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so\nintense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx\u2019s in the desert. \u201cSpeak, thou vast\nand venerable head,\u201d muttered Ahab, \u201cwhich, though ungarnished with a\nbeard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty\nhead, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou\nhast dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams,\nhas moved amid this world\u2019s foundations. Where unrecorded names and\nnavies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous\nhold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the\ndrowned; there, in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar\nhome. Thou hast been where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many\na sailor\u2019s side, where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay\nthem down.
