A\npretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the\nbroad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! \u201cQueequeg!\u2014in the name of\ngoodness, Queequeg, wake!\u201d At length, by dint of much wriggling, and\nloud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\nhugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\nextracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself\nall over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in\nbed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if\nhe did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\nconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\nhim. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\nnow, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\nlast, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\nand he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\nthe floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\nif it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\nafterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\nunder the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the\ntruth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you\nwill; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\nparticular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\ncivility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\nstaring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for\nthe time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,\na man like Queequeg you don\u2019t see every day, he and his ways were well\nworth unusual regarding.\n\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\none, by the by, and then\u2014still minus his trowsers\u2014he hunted up his\nboots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\nnext movement was to crush himself\u2014boots in hand, and hat on\u2014under the\nbed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he\nwas hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I\never heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\nboots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\nstage\u2014neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\nto show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\neducation was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\nbeen a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\nhimself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\nhe never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\nlast, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over\nhis eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\nbeing much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\nones\u2014probably not made to order either\u2014rather pinched and tormented him\nat the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\n\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\nstreet being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\ninto the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\nQueequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;\nI begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and\nparticularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He\ncomplied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the\nmorning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\namazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his\nchest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a\npiece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water\nand commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept\nhis razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed\ncorner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it\na little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the\nwall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.\nThinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers\u2019s best cutlery with a\nvengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came\nto know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how\nexceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.\n\nThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of\nthe room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his\nharpoon like a marshal\u2019s baton.\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. Breakfast.\n\nI quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the\ngrinning landlord very pleasantly.
