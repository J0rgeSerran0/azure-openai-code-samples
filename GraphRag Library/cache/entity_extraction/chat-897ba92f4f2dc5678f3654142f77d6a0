But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a\nproportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the\nmost complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it\nin this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under\nyour arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion\nof the general structure we are about to view.\n\nIn length, the Sperm Whale\u2019s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\nfeet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\nbeen ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\nfifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two\nfeet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty\nfeet of plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less\nthan a third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs\nwhich once enclosed his vitals.\n\nTo me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\nextending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\nthe hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\ntwenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,\nfor the time, but a long, disconnected timber.\n\nThe ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was\nnearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\nsuccessively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\nof the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From\nthat part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only\nspanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore\na seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most\narched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay\nfootpath bridges over small streams.\n\nIn considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\ncircumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of\nthe whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of\nthe Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the\nfish which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of\nthe invested body of this particular whale must have been at least\nsixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more\nthan eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion\nof the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I\nnow saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with\ntons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for\nthe ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of\nthe weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\n\nHow vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try\nto comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his\ndead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in\nthe heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his\nangry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully\ninvested whale be truly and livingly found out.\n\nBut the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a\ncrane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now\nit\u2019s done, it looks much like Pompey\u2019s Pillar.\n\nThere are forty and odd vertebr\u00e6 in all, which in the skeleton are not\nlocked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a\nGothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a\nmiddle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth\nmore than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the\ntail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white\nbilliard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they\nhad been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest\u2019s children,\nwho had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the\nspine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into\nsimple child\u2019s play.\n\n\nCHAPTER 104. The Fossil Whale.\n\nFrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon\nto enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not\ncompress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial\nfolio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and\nthe yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic\nin\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
