Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down\nwith the Yarman! Sail over him!\u201d\n\nBut so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all\ntheir gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not\na righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the\nblade of his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to\nfree his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick\u2019s boat was nigh\nto capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;\u2014that\nwas a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took\na mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German\u2019s\nquarter. An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the\nwhale\u2019s immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was\nthe foaming swell that he made.\n\nIt was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was\nnow going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual\ntormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of\nfright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering\nflight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank\nin the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So\nhave I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles\nin the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird\nhas a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the\nfear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted\nin him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his\nspiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while\nstill, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there\nwas enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.\n\nSeeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod\u2019s\nboats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick\nchose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long\ndart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.\n\nBut no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all\nthree tigers\u2014Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo\u2014instinctively sprang to their\nfeet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their\nbarbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three\nNantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and\nwhite-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale\u2019s headlong\nrush, bumped the German\u2019s aside with such force, that both Derick and\nhis baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three\nflying keels.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, my butter-boxes,\u201d cried Stubb, casting a passing\nglance upon them as he shot by; \u201cye\u2019ll be picked up presently\u2014all\nright\u2014I saw some sharks astern\u2014St. Bernard\u2019s dogs, you know\u2014relieve\ndistressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel\na sunbeam! Hurrah!\u2014Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a\nmad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a\ntilbury on a plain\u2014makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to\nhim that way; and there\u2019s danger of being pitched out too, when you\nstrike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he\u2019s going\nto Davy Jones\u2014all a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this\nwhale carries the everlasting mail!\u201d\n\nBut the monster\u2019s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he\ntumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round\nthe loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;\nwhile so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would\nsoon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they\ncaught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at\nlast\u2014owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of\nthe boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue\u2014the\ngunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three\nsterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for\nsome time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more\nline, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have\nbeen taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this \u201cholding on,\u201d as\nit is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from\nthe back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising\nagain to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the\nperil of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always\nthe best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the\nstricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted.
