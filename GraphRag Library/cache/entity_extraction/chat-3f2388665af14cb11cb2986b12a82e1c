And here, gentlemen, the foul play\nof these miscreants must come out.\n\n\u201cUpon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own\nseparate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece\nof treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be\nthe first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and\nthereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might\nmerit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead\nthem to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of\nvillany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their\nleader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in\nthree sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with\ncords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.\n\n\u201cThinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he\nand all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a\nfew minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still\nstruggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious\nallies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been\nfully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along\nthe deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the\nmizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till\nmorning. \u2018Damn ye,\u2019 cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,\n\u2018the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!\u2019\n\n\u201cAt sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had\nrebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the\nformer that he had a good mind to flog them all round\u2014thought, upon the\nwhole, he would do so\u2014he ought to\u2014justice demanded it; but for the\npresent, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with\na reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.\n\n\u201c\u2018But as for you, ye carrion rogues,\u2019 turning to the three men in the\nrigging\u2014\u2018for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;\u2019 and, seizing\na rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two\ntraitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads\nsideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.\n\n\u201c\u2018My wrist is sprained with ye!\u2019 he cried, at last; \u2018but there is still\nrope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn\u2019t give up. Take\nthat gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.\u2019\n\n\u201cFor a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his\ncramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a\nsort of hiss, \u2018What I say is this\u2014and mind it well\u2014if you flog me, I\nmurder you!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me\u2019\u2014and the Captain drew off with\nthe rope to strike.\n\n\u201c\u2018Best not,\u2019 hissed the Lakeman.\n\n\u201c\u2018But I must,\u2019\u2014and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.\n\n\u201cSteelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain;\nwho, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck\nrapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope,\nsaid, \u2018I won\u2019t do it\u2014let him go\u2014cut him down: d\u2019ye hear?\u2019\n\n\u201cBut as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale\nman, with a bandaged head, arrested them\u2014Radney the chief mate. Ever\nsince the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the\ntumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the\nwhole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly\nspeak; but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do\nwhat the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced\nto his pinioned foe.\n\n\u201c\u2018You are a coward!\u2019 hissed the Lakeman.\n\n\u201c\u2018So I am, but take that.\u2019 The mate was in the very act of striking,\nwhen another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing\nno more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt\u2019s threat, whatever that\nmight have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were\nturned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps\nclanged as before.\n\n\u201cJust after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor\nwas heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,\nbesieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.\nEntreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own\ninstance they were put down in the ship\u2019s run for salvation. Still, no\nsign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,\nthat mainly at Steelkilt\u2019s instigation, they had resolved to maintain\nthe strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
