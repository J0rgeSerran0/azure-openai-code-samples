In fact, you would a good deal\nrather not sleep with your own brother. I don\u2019t know how it is, but\npeople like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\nsleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,\nand that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely\nmultiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should\nsleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep\ntwo in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all\nsleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and\ncover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\n\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\nthought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a\nharpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of\nthe tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.\nBesides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home\nand going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at\nmidnight\u2014how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?\n\n\u201cLandlord! I\u2019ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.\u2014I shan\u2019t sleep\nwith him. I\u2019ll try the bench here.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as you please; I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t spare ye a tablecloth for a\nmattress, and it\u2019s a plaguy rough board here\u201d\u2014feeling of the knots and\nnotches. \u201cBut wait a bit, Skrimshander; I\u2019ve got a carpenter\u2019s plane\nthere in the bar\u2014wait, I say, and I\u2019ll make ye snug enough.\u201d So saying\nhe procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting\nthe bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning\nlike an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the\nplane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was\nnear spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven\u2019s sake to quit\u2014the\nbed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing\nin the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the\nshavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in\nthe middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a\nbrown study.\n\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\nshort; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too\nnarrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\nthan the planed one\u2014so there was no yoking them. I then placed the\nfirst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\nleaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I\nsoon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from\nunder the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,\nespecially as another current from the rickety door met the one from\nthe window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in\nthe immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the\nnight.\n\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn\u2019t I steal\na march on him\u2014bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\nwakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon\nsecond thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next\nmorning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be\nstanding in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\n\nStill, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\nspending a sufferable night unless in some other person\u2019s bed, I began\nto think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices\nagainst this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I\u2019ll wait awhile; he must be\ndropping in before long. I\u2019ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps\nwe may become jolly good bedfellows after all\u2014there\u2019s no telling.\n\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,\nand going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\n\n\u201cLandlord!\u201d said I, \u201cwhat sort of a chap is he\u2014does he always keep such\nlate hours?\u201d It was now hard upon twelve o\u2019clock.\n\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\nmightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. \u201cNo,\u201d he\nanswered, \u201cgenerally he\u2019s an early bird\u2014airley to bed and airley to\nrise\u2014yes, he\u2019s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out\na peddling, you see, and I don\u2019t see what on airth keeps him so late,\nunless, may be, he can\u2019t sell his head.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t sell his head?\u2014What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are\ntelling me?\u201d getting into a towering rage. \u201cDo you pretend to say,\nlandlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed\nSaturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
