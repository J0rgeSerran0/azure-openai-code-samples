The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,\nnot a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,\nStubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the\nlanguishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,\nwhere he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed\nhome the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his\nmatch across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his\nharpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed\nstars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat,\ncrying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, \u201cDown, down all, and give\nway!\u2014there they are!\u201d\n\nTo a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been\nvisible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white\nwater, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and\nsuffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white\nrolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it\nwere, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this\natmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of\nwater, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other\nindications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning\ncouriers and detached flying outriders.\n\nAll four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled\nwater and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as\na mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the\nhills.\n\n\u201cPull, pull, my good boys,\u201d said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but\nintensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance\nfrom his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two\nvisible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much\nto his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the\nsilence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his\npeculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.\n\nHow different the loud little King-Post. \u201cSing out and say something,\nmy hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on\ntheir black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I\u2019ll sign over to you\nmy Martha\u2019s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children,\nboys. Lay me on\u2014lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring\nmad! See! see that white water!\u201d And so shouting, he pulled his hat\nfrom his head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up,\nflirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and\nplunging in the boat\u2019s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.\n\n\u201cLook at that chap now,\u201d philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his\nunlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a\nshort distance, followed after\u2014\u201cHe\u2019s got fits, that Flask has. Fits?\nyes, give him fits\u2014that\u2019s the very word\u2014pitch fits into \u2019em. Merrily,\nmerrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;\u2014merry\u2019s the word.\nPull, babes\u2014pull, sucklings\u2014pull, all. But what the devil are you\nhurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull, and\nkeep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite your\nknives in two\u2014that\u2019s all. Take it easy\u2014why don\u2019t ye take it easy, I\nsay, and burst all your livers and lungs!\u201d\n\nBut what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of\nhis\u2014these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed\nlight of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious\nseas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of\nred murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.\n\nMeanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of\nFlask to \u201cthat whale,\u201d as he called the fictitious monster which he\ndeclared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat\u2019s bow with its\ntail\u2014these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that\nthey would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look\nover the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must\nput out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage\npronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but\narms, in these critical moments.\n\nIt was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the\nomnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled\nalong the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless\nbowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip\nfor an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost\nseemed threatening to cut it in two; the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
