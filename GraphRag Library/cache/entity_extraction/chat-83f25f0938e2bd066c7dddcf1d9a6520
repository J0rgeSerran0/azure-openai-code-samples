It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in\nthe heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle,\nand you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest\nwarning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and\nsimultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a\nMazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could\nnever pierce you out.\n\nAgain: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and\nprophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;\nfor, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and\ncontains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal\npowder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the\nline, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought\ninto actual play\u2014this is a thing which carries more of true terror than\nany other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men\nlive enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their\nnecks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,\nthat mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.\nAnd if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would\nnot at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before\nyour evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.\n\n\nCHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.\n\nIf to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to\nQueequeg it was quite a different object.\n\n\u201cWhen you see him \u2019quid,\u201d said the savage, honing his harpoon in the\nbow of his hoisted boat, \u201cthen you quick see him \u2019parm whale.\u201d\n\nThe next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special\nto engage them, the Pequod\u2019s crew could hardly resist the spell of\nsleep induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean\nthrough which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively\nground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins,\nflying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than\nthose off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.\n\nIt was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders\nleaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed\nin what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in\nthat dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of\nmy body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will,\nlong after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.\n\nEre forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the\nseamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that\nat last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every\nswing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering\nhelmsman. The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the\nwide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.\n\nSuddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my\nhands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved\nme; with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not\nforty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like\nthe capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian\nhue, glistening in the sun\u2019s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating\nin the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his\nvapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of\na warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck\nby some enchanter\u2019s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all\nat once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from\nall parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from\naloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and\nregularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.\n\n\u201cClear away the boats! Luff!\u201d cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he\ndashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.\n\nThe sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and\nere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the\nleeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples\nas he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed,\nAhab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak\nbut in whispers.
