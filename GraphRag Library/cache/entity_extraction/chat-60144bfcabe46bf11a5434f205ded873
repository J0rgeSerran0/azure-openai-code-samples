But it was only a few\nfeet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did\ngain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning\nalong the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship,\nsuddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so\nflinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken\nglass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once\nmore the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed,\nand blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship\ntowing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete\ncircuit.\n\nMeantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close\nflanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance;\nand thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the\nmultitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale\u2019s body,\nrushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every\nnew gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains\nthat poured from the smitten rock.\n\nAt last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he\nturned upon his back a corpse.\n\nWhile the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,\nand in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some\nconversation ensued between them.\n\n\u201cI wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,\u201d said\nStubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so\nignoble a leviathan.\n\n\u201cWants with it?\u201d said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat\u2019s bow,\n\u201cdid you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale\u2019s\nhead hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right\nWhale\u2019s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can\nnever afterwards capsize?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so,\nand he seems to know all about ships\u2019 charms. But I sometimes think\nhe\u2019ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don\u2019t half like that chap,\nStubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved\ninto a snake\u2019s head, Stubb?\u201d\n\n\u201cSink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a\ndark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look\ndown there, Flask\u201d\u2014pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both\nhands\u2014\u201cAye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in\ndisguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been\nstowed away on board ship? He\u2019s the devil, I say. The reason why you\ndon\u2019t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries\nit coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of\nit, he\u2019s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sleeps in his boots, don\u2019t he? He hasn\u2019t got any hammock; but I\u2019ve\nseen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo doubt, and it\u2019s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye\nsee, in the eye of the rigging.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the old man have so much to do with him for?\u201d\n\n\u201cStriking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cBargain?\u2014about what?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and\nthe devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away\nhis silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then\nhe\u2019ll surrender Moby Dick.\u201d\n\n\u201cPooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked\none, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old\nflag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and\ngentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he\nwas at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching\nhis hoofs, up and says, \u2018I want John.\u2019 \u2018What for?\u2019 says the old\ngovernor. \u2018What business is that of yours,\u2019 says the devil, getting\nmad,\u2014\u2018I want to use him.\u2019 \u2018Take him,\u2019 says the governor\u2014and by the\nLord, Flask, if the devil didn\u2019t give John the Asiatic cholera before\nhe got through with him, I\u2019ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look\nsharp\u2014ain\u2019t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let\u2019s get\nthe whale alongside.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I remember some such story as you were telling,\u201d said Flask,\nwhen at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden\ntowards the ship, \u201cbut I can\u2019t remember where.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Spaniards?
