If old Rad were here now, I\u2019d tell him\nto jump overboard and scatter \u2019em. They\u2019re playing the devil with his\nestate, I can tell him. But he\u2019s a simple old soul,\u2014Rad, and a beauty\ntoo. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in\nlooking-glasses. I wonder if he\u2019d give a poor devil like me the model\nof his nose.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Damn your eyes! what\u2019s that pump stopping for?\u2019 roared Radney,\npretending not to have heard the sailors\u2019 talk. \u2018Thunder away at it!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Aye, aye, sir,\u2019 said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. \u2018Lively, boys,\nlively, now!\u2019 And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines;\nthe men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping\nof the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life\u2019s\nutmost energies.\n\n\u201cQuitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went\nforward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face\nfiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his\nbrow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney\nto meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know\nnot; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate\ncommanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a\nshovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a\npig to run at large.\n\n\u201cNow, gentlemen, sweeping a ship\u2019s deck at sea is a piece of household\nwork which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every\nevening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually\nfoundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of\nsea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom\nwould not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all\nvessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,\nif boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the\nTown-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps;\nand being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been\nregularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should\nhave been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly\nnautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all\nthese particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair\nstood between the two men.\n\n\u201cBut there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as\nplainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat\nin his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\nunderstand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\nfully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat\nstill for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate\u2019s\nmalignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him\nand the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\ninstinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness\nto stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being\u2014a\nrepugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when\naggrieved\u2014this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over\nSteelkilt.\n\n\u201cTherefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\nexhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping\nthe deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then,\nwithout at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the\ncustomary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done\nlittle or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a\nmost domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his\ncommand; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an\nuplifted cooper\u2019s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near\nby.\n\n\u201cHeated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for\nall his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt\ncould but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still\nsmothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained\ndoggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the\nhammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do\nhis bidding.\n\n\u201cSteelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\nfollowed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated\nhis intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had\nnot the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\nhis twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\nwas to no purpose.
