Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were\non the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they\noccasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.\n\n\u201cSome two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about\nrehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,\nwas cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days\u2019 sail eastward\nfrom the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the\nnorthward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according\nto daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold\nthan common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But\nthe captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good\nluck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to\nquit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous,\nthough, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low\ndown as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued\nher cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy\nintervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was\nthe leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that\nnow taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the\nnearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and\nrepaired.\n\n\u201cThough no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance\nfavoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the\nway, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically\nrelieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the\nship free; never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well\nnigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous\nbreezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at\nher port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been\nfor the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the\nbitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from\nBuffalo.\n\n\u201c\u2018Lakeman!\u2014Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?\u2019\nsaid Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.\n\n\u201cOn the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but\u2014I crave your\ncourtesy\u2014may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,\ngentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as\nlarge and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far\nManilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet\nbeen nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly\nconnected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate,\nthose grand fresh-water seas of ours,\u2014Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and\nSuperior, and Michigan,\u2014possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many\nof the ocean\u2019s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of\nraces and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic\nisles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by\ntwo great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long\nmaritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East,\ndotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by\nbatteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they\nhave heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they\nyield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash\nfrom out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by\nancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried\nlines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild\nAfric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give\nrobes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and\nCleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the\nfull-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer,\nand the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as\ndireful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks\nare, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full\nmany a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen,\nthough an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean\nnurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney,\nthough in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket\nbeach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long\nfollowed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was\nhe quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods\nseaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-h\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
