However, it is always as well to\nhave a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his\nhands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain\nAhab was to be found.\n\n\u201cAnd what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It\u2019s all right enough; thou\nart shipped.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but I should like to see him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don\u2019t know\nexactly what\u2019s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\nhouse; a sort of sick, and yet he don\u2019t look so. In fact, he ain\u2019t\nsick; but no, he isn\u2019t well either. Any how, young man, he won\u2019t always\nsee me, so I don\u2019t suppose he will thee. He\u2019s a queer man, Captain\nAhab\u2014so some think\u2014but a good one. Oh, thou\u2019lt like him well enough; no\nfear, no fear. He\u2019s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab;\ndoesn\u2019t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen.\nMark ye, be forewarned; Ahab\u2019s above the common; Ahab\u2019s been in\ncolleges, as well as \u2019mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders\nthan the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than\nwhales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our\nisle! Oh! he ain\u2019t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain\u2019t Captain Peleg;\n_he\u2019s Ahab_, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did\nthey not lick his blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome hither to me\u2014hither, hither,\u201d said Peleg, with a significance in\nhis eye that almost startled me. \u201cLook ye, lad; never say that on board\nthe Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.\n\u2019Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died\nwhen he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at\nGayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And,\nperhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn\nthee. It\u2019s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I\u2019ve sailed with him as\nmate years ago; I know what he is\u2014a good man\u2014not a pious, good man,\nlike Bildad, but a swearing good man\u2014something like me\u2014only there\u2019s a\ngood deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly;\nand I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind\nfor a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump\nthat brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever\nsince he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he\u2019s been a\nkind of moody\u2014desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all\npass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young\nman, it\u2019s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\none. So good-bye to thee\u2014and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens\nto have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife\u2014not three voyages\nwedded\u2014a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that\nold man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm\nin Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his\nhumanities!\u201d\n\nAs I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been\nincidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain\nwild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time,\nI felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don\u2019t know what,\nunless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange\nawe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was\nnot exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did\nnot disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed\nlike mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.\nHowever, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so\nthat for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.\n\n\nCHAPTER 17.
