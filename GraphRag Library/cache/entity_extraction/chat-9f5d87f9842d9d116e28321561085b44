Merchant ships are but extension bridges;\narmed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though\nfollowing the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships,\nother fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw\ntheir living from the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone\nresides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to\nit in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.\n_There_ is his home; _there_ lies his business, which a Noah\u2019s flood\nwould not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China.\nHe lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among\nthe waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years\nhe knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells\nlike another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.\nWith the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to\nsleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight\nof land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his\nvery pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.\n\n\nCHAPTER 15. Chowder.\n\nIt was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to\nanchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no\nbusiness that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord\nof the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the\nTry Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept\nhotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin\nHosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he\nplainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck\nat the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a\nyellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to\nthe larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a\ncorner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first\nman we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very\nmuch puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg\ninsisted that the yellow warehouse\u2014our first point of departure\u2014must be\nleft on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say\nit was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in\nthe dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to\ninquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no\nmistaking.\n\nTwo enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses\u2019 ears,\nswung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an\nold doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other\nside, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.\nPerhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I\ncould not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort\nof crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes,\n_two_ of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It\u2019s ominous, thinks\nI. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;\ntombstones staring at me in the whalemen\u2019s chapel; and here a gallows!\nand a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out\noblique hints touching Tophet?\n\nI was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman\nwith yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,\nunder a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured\neye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen\nshirt.\n\n\u201cGet along with ye,\u201d said she to the man, \u201cor I\u2019ll be combing ye!\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, Queequeg,\u201d said I, \u201call right. There\u2019s Mrs. Hussey.\u201d\n\nAnd so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving\nMrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon\nmaking known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,\npostponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little\nroom, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently\nconcluded repast, turned round to us and said\u2014\u201cClam or Cod?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that about Cods, ma\u2019am?\u201d said I, with much politeness.\n\n\u201cClam or Cod?\u201d she repeated.\n\n\u201cA clam for supper? a cold clam; is _that_ what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?\u201d\nsays I, \u201cbut that\u2019s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter\ntime, ain\u2019t it, Mrs. Hussey?\u201d\n\nBut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple\nShirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing\nbut the word \u201cclam,\u201d Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading\nto the kitchen, and bawling out \u201cclam for two,\u201d disappeared.\n\n\u201cQueequeg,\u201d said I\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
