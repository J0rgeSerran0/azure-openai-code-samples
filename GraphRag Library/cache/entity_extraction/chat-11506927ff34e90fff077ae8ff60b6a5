There now\u2019s a patched professor in Queen Nature\u2019s\ngranite-founded College; but methinks he\u2019s too subservient. Where wert\nthou born?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent! Thou\u2019st hit the world by that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know not, sir, but I was born there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it\u2019s good. Here\u2019s a man\nfrom Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man;\nwhich is sucked in\u2014by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall\nbutts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.\u201d\n\nThe log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long\ndragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In\nturn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing\nresistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.\n\n\u201cHold hard!\u201d\n\nSnap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the\ntugging log was gone.\n\n\u201cI crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad\nsea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian;\nreel up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and\nmend thou the line. See to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere he goes now; to him nothing\u2019s happened; but to me, the skewer\nseems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in,\nTahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and\ndragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?\u201d\n\n\u201cPip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip\u2019s missing.\nLet\u2019s see now if ye haven\u2019t fished him up here, fisherman. It drags\nhard; I guess he\u2019s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul\nin no cowards here. Ho! there\u2019s his arm just breaking water. A hatchet!\na hatchet! cut it off\u2014we haul in no cowards here.

Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned\nhim, ye creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab\u2019s cabin shall be Pip\u2019s\nhome henceforth, while Ahab lives.

Oh, sir, let old Perth\nnow come and rivet these two hands together; the black one with the\nwhite, for I will not let this go.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse\nhorrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in\ngods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods\noblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not\nwhat he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come!\nI feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an\nEmperor\u2019s!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere go two daft ones now,\u201d muttered the old Manxman. \u201cOne daft with\nstrength, the other daft with weakness.
