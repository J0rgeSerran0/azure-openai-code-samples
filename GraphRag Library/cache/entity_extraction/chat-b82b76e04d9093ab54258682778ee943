And still as Ahab glided over the waves\nthe unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to\nthe boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades\nbecame jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at\nalmost every dip.\n\n\u201cHeed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull\non! \u2019tis the better rest, the shark\u2019s jaw than the yielding water.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will last long enough! pull on!\u2014But who can tell\u201d\u2014he\nmuttered\u2014\u201cwhether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on\nAhab?\u2014But pull on! Aye, all alive, now\u2014we near him. The helm! take the\nhelm! let me pass,\u201d\u2014and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward\nto the bows of the still flying boat.\n\nAt length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with\nthe White Whale\u2019s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its\nadvance\u2014as the whale sometimes will\u2014and Ahab was fairly within the\nsmoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale\u2019s spout, curled\nround his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,\nwith body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the\npoise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the\nhated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked\ninto a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his\nnigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so\nsuddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated\npart of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have\nbeen tossed into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmen\u2014who foreknew\nnot the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for\nits effects\u2014these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two\nof them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a\ncombing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man\nhelplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,\ninstantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering\nsea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with\nthe line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their\nseats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line\nfelt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!\n\n\u201cWhat breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!\u2014\u2019tis whole again; oars! oars!\nBurst in upon him!\u201d\n\nHearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled\nround to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,\ncatching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing\nin it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it\u2014it may be\u2014a\nlarger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing\nprow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.\n\nAhab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. \u201cI grow blind; hands!\nstretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is\u2019t night?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whale! The ship!\u201d cried the cringing oarsmen.\n\n\u201cOars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for\never too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I\nsee: the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?\u201d\n\nBut as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the\nsledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks\nburst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat\nlay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew,\ntrying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.\n\nMeantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego\u2019s mast-head hammer\nremained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as\nwith a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own\nforward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the\nbowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon\nas he.\n\n\u201cThe whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of\nair, now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a\nwoman\u2019s fainting fit. Up helm, I say\u2014ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is\nthis the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities?\nOh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up\nhelm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on\ntowards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart.
