I but put that brow before you. Read it if you\ncan.\n\n\nCHAPTER 80. The Nut.\n\nIf the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist\nhis brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to\nsquare.\n\nIn the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet\nin length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as\nthe side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level\nbase. But in life\u2014as we have elsewhere seen\u2014this inclined plane is\nangularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent\nmass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to\nbed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater\u2014in\nanother cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in\ndepth\u2014reposes the mere handful of this monster\u2019s brain. The brain is at\nleast twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away\nbehind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the\namplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it\nsecreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny\nthat the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance\nof one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in\nstrange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it\nseems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that\nmystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.\n\nIt is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in\nthe creature\u2019s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his\ntrue brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The\nwhale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the\ncommon world.\n\nIf you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view\nof its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its\nresemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from\nthe same point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down\nto the human magnitude) among a plate of men\u2019s skulls, and you would\ninvoluntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on\none part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say\u2014This man\nhad no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations,\nconsidered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and\npower, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most\nexhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.\n\nBut if from the comparative dimensions of the whale\u2019s proper brain, you\ndeem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea\nfor you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped\u2019s spine, you\nwill be struck with the resemblance of its vertebr\u00e6 to a strung\nnecklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the\nskull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebr\u00e6 are absolutely\nundeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the\nGermans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once\npointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with\nthe vertebr\u00e6 of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the\nbeaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have\nomitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the\ncerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man\u2019s\ncharacter will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel\nyour spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine\nnever yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in\nthe firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the\nworld.\n\nApply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial\ncavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra\nthe bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being\neight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As\nit passes through the remaining vertebr\u00e6 the canal tapers in size, but\nfor a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course,\nthis canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance\u2014the\nspinal cord\u2014as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain. And\nwhat is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain\u2019s\ncavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal\nto that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be\nunreasonable to survey and map out the whale\u2019s spine phrenologically?\nFor, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his\nbrain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative\nmagnitude of his spinal cord.\n\nBut leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I\nwould merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the\nSperm Whale\u2019s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one\nof the larger vertebr\u00e6, and is, therefore, in some sort, the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
