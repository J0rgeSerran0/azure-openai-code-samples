Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a\nrobust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?\nWhy upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a\nmystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out\nof sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did\nthe Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely\nall this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that\nstory of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild\nimage he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that\nsame image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image\nof the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\n\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin\nto grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my\nlungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a\npassenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a\npurse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers\nget sea-sick\u2014grow quarrelsome\u2014don\u2019t sleep of nights\u2014do not enjoy\nthemselves much, as a general thing;\u2014no, I never go as a passenger;\nnor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a\nCommodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction\nof such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all\nhonorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind\nwhatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,\nwithout taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.\nAnd as for going as cook,\u2014though I confess there is considerable glory\nin that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board\u2014yet, somehow, I\nnever fancied broiling fowls;\u2014though once broiled, judiciously\nbuttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who\nwill speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled\nfowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old\nEgyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the\nmummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\n\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\nplumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\nTrue, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to\nspar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of\nthing is unpleasant enough. It touches one\u2019s sense of honor,\nparticularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the\nVan Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if\njust previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been\nlording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in\nawe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a\nschoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and\nthe Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off\nin time.\n\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom\nand sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,\nI mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel\nGabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and\nrespectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain\u2019t\na slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may\norder me about\u2014however they may thump and punch me about, I have the\nsatisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is\none way or other served in much the same way\u2014either in a physical or\nmetaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is\npassed round, and all hands should rub each other\u2019s shoulder-blades,\nand be content.\n\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\npaying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single\npenny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must\npay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and\nbeing paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable\ninfliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being\npaid_,\u2014what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man\nreceives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly\nbelieve money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no\naccount can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign\nourselves to perdition!\n\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\nexercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,\nhead winds are far more prevalent\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
