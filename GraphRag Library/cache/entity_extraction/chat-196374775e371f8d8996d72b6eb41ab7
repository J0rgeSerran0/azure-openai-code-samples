Wheelbarrow.\n\nNext morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,\nfor a block, I settled my own and comrade\u2019s bill; using, however, my\ncomrade\u2019s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed\namazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between\nme and Queequeg\u2014especially as Peter Coffin\u2019s cock and bull stories\nabout him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person\nwhom I now companied with.\n\nWe borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own\npoor carpet-bag, and Queequeg\u2019s canvas sack and hammock, away we went\ndown to \u201cthe Moss,\u201d the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the\nwharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so\nmuch\u2014for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\nstreets,\u2014but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we\nheeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg\nnow and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I\nasked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\nwhether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in\nsubstance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet\nhe had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of\nassured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate\nwith the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and\nmowers, who go into the farmers\u2019 meadows armed with their own\nscythes\u2014though in no wise obliged to furnish them\u2014even so, Queequeg,\nfor his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.\n\nShifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about\nthe first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The\nowners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his\nheavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the\nthing\u2014though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in\nwhich to manage the barrow\u2014Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it\nfast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. \u201cWhy,\u201d\nsaid I, \u201cQueequeg, you might have known better than that, one would\nthink. Didn\u2019t the people laugh?\u201d\n\nUpon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of\nRokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water\nof young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and\nthis punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided\nmat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once\ntouched at Rokovoko, and its commander\u2014from all accounts, a very\nstately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain\u2014this\ncommander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg\u2019s sister, a\npretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding\nguests were assembled at the bride\u2019s bamboo cottage, this Captain\nmarches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over\nagainst the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the\nKing, Queequeg\u2019s father. Grace being said,\u2014for those people have their\ngrace as well as we\u2014though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such\ntimes look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying\nthe ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts\u2014Grace, I\nsay, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial\nceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and\nconsecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage\ncirculates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the\nceremony, and thinking himself\u2014being Captain of a ship\u2014as having plain\nprecedence over a mere island King, especially in the King\u2019s own\nhouse\u2014the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the\npunchbowl;\u2014taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. \u201cNow,\u201d said\nQueequeg, \u201cwhat you tink now?\u2014Didn\u2019t our people laugh?\u201d\n\nAt last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the\nschooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one\nside, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees\nall glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of\ncasks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the\nworld-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while\nfrom others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises\nof fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises\nwere on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only\nbegins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on,\nfor ever and for aye.
