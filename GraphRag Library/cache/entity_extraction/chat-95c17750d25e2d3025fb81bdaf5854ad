But calm, snow-white, and\nunvarying; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky; still\nbeckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be\ndescried.\n\nDuring all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for\nthe time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous\ndeck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever\naddressed his mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything\nabove and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but\npassively to await the issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become\npractical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted into its\naccustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for\nhours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an\noccasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very\neyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of\nthe ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,\nstood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to\nguard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a\nsort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened\nbelt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by\npainted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift\nmadness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness\nof humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence\nthe men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the\nblast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not\nseek that repose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old\nman\u2019s aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the\nbarometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his\nfloor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from\nwhich he had some time before emerged, still slowly dripping from the\nunremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him lay unrolled one of\nthose charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken\nof. His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand. Though the body\nwas erect, the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were\npointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in\nthe ceiling.*\n\n*The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to\nthe compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself\nof the course of the ship.\n\nTerrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this\ngale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.\n\n\nCHAPTER 52. The Albatross.\n\nSouth-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising\nground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross)\nby name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the\nfore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro\nin the far ocean fisheries\u2014a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.\n\nAs if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the\nskeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral\nappearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all\nher spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred\nover with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it\nwas to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They\nseemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment\nthat had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops\nnailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and\nthough, when the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men\nin the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped\nfrom the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those\nforlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not\none word to our own look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being\nheard from below.\n\n\u201cShip ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?\u201d\n\nBut as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in\nthe act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his\nhand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to\nmake himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing\nthe distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the\nPequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the\nfirst mere mention of the White Whale\u2019s name to another ship, Ahab for\na moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a\nboat to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
