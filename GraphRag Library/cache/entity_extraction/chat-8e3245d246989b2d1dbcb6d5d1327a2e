But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted\nto the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab\u2019s) did\nnot escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling\nship\u2019s high teetering side, stove in the boat\u2019s bottom at the stern,\nand left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.\n\n\u201cBad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,\u201d said Stubb, regarding the wreck,\n\u201cbut the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can\u2019t fight it. You\nsee, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps,\nall round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me,\nall the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But\nnever mind; it\u2019s all in fun: so the old song says;\u201d\u2014(_sings_.)\n\n\n  Oh! jolly is the gale, And a joker is the whale, A\u2019 flourishin\u2019 his\n  tail,\u2014 Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the\n  Ocean, oh!\n\n  The scud all a flyin\u2019, That\u2019s his flip only foamin\u2019; When he stirs in\n  the spicin\u2019,\u2014 Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,\n  is the Ocean, oh!\n\n  Thunder splits the ships, But he only smacks his lips, A tastin\u2019 of\n  this flip,\u2014 Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,\n  is the Ocean, oh!\n\n\n\n\u201cAvast Stubb,\u201d cried Starbuck, \u201clet the Typhoon sing, and strike his\nharp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold\nthy peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;\nand I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr.\nStarbuck, there\u2019s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my\nthroat. And when that\u2019s done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a\nwind-up.\u201d\n\n\u201cMadman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never\nmind how foolish?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere!\u201d cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his\nhand towards the weather bow, \u201cmarkest thou not that the gale comes\nfrom the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the\nvery course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where\nis that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand\u2014his\nstand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou\nmust!\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t half understand ye: what\u2019s in the wind?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to\nNantucket,\u201d soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb\u2019s\nquestion. \u201cThe gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it\ninto a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,\nall is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward\u2014I see it lightens up\nthere; but not with the lightning.\u201d\n\nAt that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following\nthe flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same\ninstant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\n\n\u201cOld Thunder!\u201d said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his\npivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed\nlances of fire.\n\nNow, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off\nthe perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some\nships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But\nas this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may\navoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly\ntowing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering\nnot a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the\nvessel\u2019s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a\nship\u2019s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made\nin long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the\nchains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.\n\n\u201cThe rods! the rods!\u201d cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished\nto vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting\nflambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. \u201cAre they overboard? drop them\nover, fore and aft. Quick!\u201d\n\n\u201cAvast!\u201d cried Ahab; \u201clet\u2019s have fair play here, though we be the\nweaker side. Yet I\u2019ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and\nAndes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let\nthem be, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook aloft!\u201d cried Starbuck.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
