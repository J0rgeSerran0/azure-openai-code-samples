He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.\n\nBOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER IV. (_Killer_).\u2014Of this whale little is\nprecisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed\nnaturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say\nthat he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage\u2014a sort of\nFeegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and\nhangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.\nThe Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has.\nException might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the\nground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on\nsea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.\n\nBOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER V. (_Thrasher_).\u2014This gentleman is famous\nfor his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He\nmounts the Folio whale\u2019s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by\nflogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar\nprocess. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both\nare outlaws, even in the lawless seas.\n\n Thus ends BOOK II. (_Octavo_), and begins BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_).\n\nDUODECIMOES.\u2014These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise.\nII. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.\n\nTo those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may\npossibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five\nfeet should be marshalled among WHALES\u2014a word, which, in the popular\nsense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down\nabove as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my\ndefinition of what a whale is\u2014_i.e._ a spouting fish, with a horizontal\ntail.\n\nBOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER 1. (_Huzza Porpoise_).\u2014This is the\ncommon porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own\nbestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something\nmust be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always\nswims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing\nthemselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their\nappearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of\nfine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward.\nThey are the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted\na lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding\nthese vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly\ngamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield\nyou one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid\nextracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among\njewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise meat\nis good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that a\nporpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very\nreadily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him;\nand you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.\n\nBOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER II. (_Algerine Porpoise_).\u2014A pirate.\nVery savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat\nlarger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make.\nProvoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many\ntimes, but never yet saw him captured.\n\nBOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER III. (_Mealy-mouthed Porpoise_).\u2014The\nlargest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it\nis known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been\ndesignated, is that of the fishers\u2014Right-Whale Porpoise, from the\ncircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In\nshape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a\nless rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and\ngentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
