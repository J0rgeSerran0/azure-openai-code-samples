What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!\nHad this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of\nDarmonodes\u2019 elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low\nsalutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their\nzones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not\npossess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet\nanother elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his\ntrunk and extracted the dart.\n\nFourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the\nmiddle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence\nof his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a\nhearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his\ntail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the\nthunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a\ngreat gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of\nvapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that\nthat was the smoke from the touch-hole.\n\nFifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes\nlie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely\nout of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into\nthe deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are\ntossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they\ndownwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime _breach_\u2014somewhere\nelse to be described\u2014this peaking of the whale\u2019s flukes is perhaps the\ngrandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless\nprofundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the\nhighest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting\nforth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in\ngazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the\nDantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the\narchangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that\ncrimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,\nall heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with\npeaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment\nof adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of\nthe fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African\nelephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most\ndevout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military\nelephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks\nuplifted in the profoundest silence.\n\nThe chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\nelephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk\nof the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite\norgans on an equality, much less the creatures to which they\nrespectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to\nLeviathan, so, compared with Leviathan\u2019s tail, his trunk is but the\nstalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant\u2019s trunk were\nas the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and\ncrash of the sperm whale\u2019s ponderous flukes, which in repeated\ninstances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their\noars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his\nballs.*\n\n*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and\nthe elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the\nelephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does\nto the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of\ncurious similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the\nelephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then\nelevating it, jet it forth in a stream.\n\nThe more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my\ninability to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which,\nthough they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly\ninexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are\nthese mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared them\nakin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these\nmethods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting\nother motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness,\nand unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I\nmay, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I\nknow not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much\nmore, how comprehend his face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my\nback parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen.\nBut I cannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will\nabout his face, I say again he has no face.\n\n\nCHAPTER 87.
