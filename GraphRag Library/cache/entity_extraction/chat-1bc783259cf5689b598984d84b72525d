The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.\n\nAnd jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down\nbefore the wind, some few weeks after Ahab\u2019s harpoon had been welded.\n\nIt was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her\nlast cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in\nglad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,\nsailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous\nto pointing her prow for home.\n\nThe three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red\nbunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,\nbottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long\nlower jaw of the last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks\nof all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways\nlashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm;\nabove which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of\nthe same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen\nlamp.\n\nAs was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most\nsurprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in\nthe same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without\nsecuring a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been\ngiven away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional\nsupplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met;\nand these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain\u2019s and\nofficers\u2019 state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked\ninto kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an\noil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the\nforecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests,\nand filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a\nhead on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged\nhis spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the\nsockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was\nfilled with sperm, except the captain\u2019s pantaloons pockets, and those\nhe reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of\nhis entire satisfaction.\n\nAs this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the\nbarbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing\nstill nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge\ntry-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like _poke_ or stomach skin\nof the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the\nclenched hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and\nharpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with\nthem from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat,\nfirmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long\nIsland negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were\npresiding over the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship\u2019s\ncompany were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from\nwhich the huge pots had been removed. You would have almost thought\nthey were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such wild cries they\nraised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the\nsea.\n\nLord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the\nship\u2019s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was\nfull before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual\ndiversion.\n\nAnd Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,\nwith a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other\u2019s\nwakes\u2014one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings\nas to things to come\u2014their two captains in themselves impersonated the\nwhole striking contrast of the scene.\n\n\u201cCome aboard, come aboard!\u201d cried the gay Bachelor\u2019s commander, lifting\na glass and a bottle in the air.\n\n\u201cHast seen the White Whale?\u201d gritted Ahab in reply.\n\n\u201cNo; only heard of him; but don\u2019t believe in him at all,\u201d said the\nother good-humoredly. \u201cCome aboard!\u201d\n\n\u201cThou art too damned jolly.

Come\nalong, will ye (merry\u2019s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow wondrous familiar is a fool!\u201d muttered Ahab; then aloud, \u201cThou art\na full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an\nempty ship,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
