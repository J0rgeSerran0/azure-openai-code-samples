Yet what\ndepths of the soul does Jonah\u2019s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant\nlesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in\nthe fish\u2019s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the\nfloods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the\nwaters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But _what_\nis this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a\ntwo-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to\nme as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us\nall, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly\nawakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally\nthe deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the\nsin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the\ncommand of God\u2014never mind now what that command was, or how\nconveyed\u2014which he found a hard command. But all the things that God\nwould have us do are hard for us to do\u2014remember that\u2014and hence, he\noftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we\nmust disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein\nthe hardness of obeying God consists.\n\n\u201cWith this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at\nGod, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men\nwill carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the\nCaptains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks\na ship that\u2019s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto\nunheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no\nother city than the modern Cadiz. That\u2019s the opinion of learned men.\nAnd where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from\nJoppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when\nthe Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern\nJaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean,\nthe Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the\nwestward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not\nthen, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?\nMiserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with\nslouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the\nshipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So\ndisordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen\nin those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had\nbeen arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he\u2019s a fugitive! no\nbaggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,\u2014no friends accompany him\nto the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he\nfinds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as\nhe steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for\nthe moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger\u2019s\nevil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and\nconfidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the\nman assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but\nstill serious way, one whispers to the other\u2014\u201cJack, he\u2019s robbed a\nwidow;\u201d or, \u201cJoe, do you mark him; he\u2019s a bigamist;\u201d or, \u201cHarry lad, I\nguess he\u2019s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike,\none of the missing murderers from Sodom.\u201d Another runs to read the bill\nthat\u2019s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is\nmoored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a\nparricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and\nlooks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now\ncrowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah\ntrembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so\nmuch the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that\nitself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the\nsailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him\npass, and he descends into the cabin.\n\n\u201c\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making\nout his papers for the Customs\u2014\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 Oh! how that harmless\nquestion mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again.\nBut he rallies. \u2018I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon\nsail ye, sir?\u2019 Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,\nthough the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that\nhollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. \u2018We sail with the\nnext coming tide,\u2019 at\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
