So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the\nboats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of\nthe noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase,\nthe monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air,\nand then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.\n\n\u201cThere go flukes!\u201d was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by\nStubb\u2019s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite\nwas granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the\nwhale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker\u2019s boat, and\nmuch nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the\nhonor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length\nbecome aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore\nno longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.\nAnd still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the\nassault.\n\nYes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy,\nhe was going \u201chead out\u201d; that part obliquely projecting from the mad\nyeast which he brewed.*\n\n*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the\nentire interior of the sperm whale\u2019s enormous head consists. Though\napparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about\nhim. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does\nso when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the\nupper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water\nformation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he\nthereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish\ngalliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.\n\n\u201cStart her, start her, my men! Don\u2019t hurry yourselves; take plenty of\ntime\u2014but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that\u2019s all,\u201d cried\nStubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. \u201cStart her, now; give \u2019em\nthe long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy\u2014start\nher, all; but keep cool, keep cool\u2014cucumbers is the word\u2014easy,\neasy\u2014only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the\nburied dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys\u2014that\u2019s all. Start\nher!\u201d\n\n\u201cWoo-hoo! Wa-hee!\u201d screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old\nwar-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat\ninvoluntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke\nwhich the eager Indian gave.\n\nBut his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. \u201cKee-hee!\nKee-hee!\u201d yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,\nlike a pacing tiger in his cage.\n\n\u201cKa-la! Koo-loo!\u201d howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a\nmouthful of Grenadier\u2019s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels\ncut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still\nencouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from\nhis mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the\nwelcome cry was heard\u2014\u201cStand up, Tashtego!\u2014give it to him!\u201d The harpoon\nwas hurled. \u201cStern all!\u201d The oarsmen backed water; the same moment\nsomething went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists. It was\nthe magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two\nadditional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its\nincreased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and\nmingled with the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round\nand round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it\nblisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb\u2019s hands, from\nwhich the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at\nthese times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy\u2019s\nsharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time\nstriving to wrest it out of your clutch.\n\n\u201cWet the line! wet the line!\u201d cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him\nseated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into\nit.* More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.\nThe boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.\nStubb and Tashtego here changed places\u2014stem for stern\u2014a staggering\nbusiness truly in that rocking commotion.\n\n*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be\nstated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
