Seeing, however, that his forbearance had\nnot the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\nhis twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\nwas to no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the\nwindlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him\nthat he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the\nLakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\n\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to\nyourself.\u2019 But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where\nthe Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of\nhis teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.\nRetreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye\nwith the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his\nright hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his\npersecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would\nmurder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter\nby the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant\nthe lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch\nspouting blood like a whale.\n\n\u201cEre the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays\nleading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their\nmastheads. They were both Canallers.\n\n\u201c\u2018Canallers!\u2019 cried Don Pedro. \u2018We have seen many whale-ships in our\nharbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are\nthey?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.\nYou must have heard of it.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary\nland, we know but little of your vigorous North.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha\u2019s very fine; and ere\nproceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such\ninformation may throw side-light upon my story.\u2019\n\n\u201cFor three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire\nbreadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and\nmost thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and\naffluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room\nand bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman\narches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or\nbroken; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk\ncounties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires\nstand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly\ncorrupt and often lawless life. There\u2019s your true Ashantee, gentlemen;\nthere howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;\nunder the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches.\nFor by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan\nfreebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so\nsinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.\n\n\u201c\u2018Is that a friar passing?\u2019 said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the\ncrowded plazza, with humorous concern.\n\n\u201c\u2018Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella\u2019s Inquisition wanes in\nLima,\u2019 laughed Don Sebastian. \u2018Proceed, Senor.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018A moment! Pardon!\u2019 cried another of the company. \u2018In the name of all\nus Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by\nno means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for\ndistant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look\nsurprised; you know the proverb all along this coast\u2014\u201cCorrupt as Lima.\u201d\nIt but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than\nbilliard-tables, and for ever open\u2014and \u201cCorrupt as Lima.\u201d So, too,\nVenice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.\nMark!\u2014St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now, you\npour out again.\u2019\n\n\u201cFreely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would\nmake a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is\nhe. Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery\nNile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked\nCleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore,\nall this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller\nso proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his\ngrand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages\nthrough which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not\nunshunned in cities.
