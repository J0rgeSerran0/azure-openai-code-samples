Sleeping? Aye, toil we\nhow we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep?

Fedallah was motionlessly\nleaning over the same rail.\n\n\nCHAPTER 133. The Chase\u2014First Day.\n\nThat night, in the mid-watch, when the old man\u2014as his wont at\nintervals\u2014stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went\nto his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing\nup the sea air as a sagacious ship\u2019s dog will, in drawing nigh to some\nbarbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that\npeculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living\nsperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner\nsurprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane,\nand then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as\npossible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship\u2019s course to be slightly\naltered, and the sail to be shortened.\n\nThe acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated\nat daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and\nlengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery\nwrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift\ntide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.\n\n\u201cMan the mast-heads! Call all hands!\u201d\n\nThundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle\ndeck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they\nseemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear\nwith their clothes in their hands.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019ye see?\u201d cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing sir!\u201d was the sound hailing down in reply.\n\n\u201cT\u2019gallant sails!\u2014stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!\u201d\n\nAll sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for\nswaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were\nhoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and\nwhile peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the\nmain-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the\nair. \u201cThere she blows!\u2014there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is\nMoby Dick!\u201d\n\nFired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three\nlook-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous\nwhale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final\nperch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just\nbeneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian\u2019s\nhead was almost on a level with Ahab\u2019s heel. From this height the whale\nwas now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing\nhis high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into\nthe air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they\nhad so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\n\n\u201cAnd did none of ye see it before?\u201d cried Ahab, hailing the perched men\nall around him.\n\n\u201cI saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I\ncried out,\u201d said Tashtego.\n\n\u201cNot the same instant; not the same\u2014no, the doubloon is mine, Fate\nreserved the doubloon for me. _I_ only; none of ye could have raised\nthe White Whale first. There she blows!\u2014there she blows!\u2014there she\nblows! There again!\u2014there again!\u201d he cried, in long-drawn, lingering,\nmethodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale\u2019s\nvisible jets. \u201cHe\u2019s going to sound! In stunsails! Down\ntop-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats.
