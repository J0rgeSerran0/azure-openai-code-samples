He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one,\nmust have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was\nlike one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, _multum in\nparvo_, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior\u2014though a little\nswelled\u2014of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of\nvarious sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,\npens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted\nto use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open\nthat part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him\nup by the legs, and there they were.\n\nYet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,\nwas, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a\ncommon soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously\ndid its duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few\ndrops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it\nhad abided for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same\nunaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept\nhim a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an\nunreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his\nbody was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking\nall the time to keep himself awake.\n\n\nCHAPTER 108.

Forward, the red\nflame of the forge is seen, where the blacksmith is at work._)\n\nDrat the file, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be soft,\nand that is soft which should be hard.

Time, time; if I but only had the\ntime, I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever (_sneezes_)\nscraped to a lady in a parlor. Those buckskin legs and calves of legs\nI\u2019ve seen in shop windows wouldn\u2019t compare at all. They soak water,\nthey do; and of course get rheumatic, and have to be doctored\n(_sneezes_) with washes and lotions, just like live legs. There; before\nI saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and see whether the\nlength will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess.
