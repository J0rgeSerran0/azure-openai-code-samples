Presently up breaches\nfrom the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white\nhead and hump, all crows\u2019 feet and wrinkles.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was he, it was he!\u201d cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended\nbreath.\n\n\u201cAnd harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, aye\u2014they were mine\u2014_my_ irons,\u201d cried Ahab, exultingly\u2014\u201cbut on!\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me a chance, then,\u201d said the Englishman, good-humoredly. \u201cWell,\nthis old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all\nafoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!\n\n\u201cAye, I see!\u2014wanted to part it; free the fast-fish\u2014an old trick\u2014I know\nhim.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow it was exactly,\u201d continued the one-armed commander, \u201cI do not\nknow; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there\nsomehow; but we didn\u2019t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled\non the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other\nwhale\u2019s; that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters\nstood, and what a noble great whale it was\u2014the noblest and biggest I\never saw, sir, in my life\u2014I resolved to capture him, spite of the\nboiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would\nget loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a\ndevil of a boat\u2019s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I\nsay, I jumped into my first mate\u2019s boat\u2014Mr. Mounttop\u2019s here (by the\nway, Captain\u2014Mounttop; Mounttop\u2014the captain);\u2014as I was saying, I jumped\ninto Mounttop\u2019s boat, which, d\u2019ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with\nmine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old\ngreat-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir\u2014hearts and souls\nalive, man\u2014the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat\u2014both eyes\nout\u2014all befogged and bedeadened with black foam\u2014the whale\u2019s tail\nlooming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble\nsteeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday,\nwith a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after\nthe second iron, to toss it overboard\u2014down comes the tail like a Lima\ntower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,\nflukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was\nall chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I\nseized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung\nto that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at\nthe same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down\nlike a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near\nme caught me here\u201d (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); \u201cyes,\ncaught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell\u2019s flames, I was\nthinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb\nript its way along the flesh\u2014clear along the whole length of my\narm\u2014came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;\u2014and that gentleman there\nwill tell you the rest (by the way, captain\u2014Dr. Bunger, ship\u2019s surgeon:\nBunger, my lad,\u2014the captain).
