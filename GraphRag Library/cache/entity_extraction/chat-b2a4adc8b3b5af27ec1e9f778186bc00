I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart\nand maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing\nsavage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a\nnature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland\ndeceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to\nfeel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that\nwould have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus\ndrew me. I\u2019ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness\nhas proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some\nfriendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At\nfirst he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my\nreferring to his last night\u2019s hospitalities, he made out to ask me\nwhether we were again to be bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I\nthought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.\n\nWe then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to\nhim the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures\nthat were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we\nwent to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to\nbe seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,\nproducing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And\nthen we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it\nregularly passing between us.\n\nIf there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan\u2019s\nbreast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and\nleft us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and\nunbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his\nforehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that\nhenceforth we were married; meaning, in his country\u2019s phrase, that we\nwere bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a\ncountryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too\npremature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage\nthose old rules would not apply.\n\nAfter supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room\ntogether. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his\nenormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some\nthirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and\nmechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them\ntowards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he\nsilenced me by pouring them into my trowsers\u2019 pockets. I let them stay.\nHe then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed\nthe paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed\nanxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I\ndeliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or\notherwise.\n\nI was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\nPresbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in\nworshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you\nsuppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and\nearth\u2014pagans and all included\u2014can possibly be jealous of an\ninsignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?\u2014to do\nthe will of God\u2014_that_ is worship. And what is the will of God?\u2014to do\nto my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me\u2014_that_ is\nthe will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish\nthat this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular\nPresbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him\nin his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped\nprop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with\nQueequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that\ndone, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences\nand all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.\n\nHow it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential\ndisclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the\nvery bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often\nlie and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our\nhearts\u2019 honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg\u2014a cosy, loving pair.\n\n\nCHAPTER 11. Nightgown.\n\nWe had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and\nQueequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs\nover mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free\nand easy were we; when, at last, by\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
