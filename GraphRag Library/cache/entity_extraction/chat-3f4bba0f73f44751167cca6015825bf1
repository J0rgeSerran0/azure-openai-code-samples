Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and\neven love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it\nvery ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle,\nseeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while\nwith mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics\naloft there in that bird\u2019s nest within three or four perches of the\npole.\n\nBut if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as\nCaptain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is\ngreatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those\nseductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used\nto lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a\nchat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;\nthen ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the\ntop-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so\nat last mount to my ultimate destination.\n\nLet me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept\nbut sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how\ncould I\u2014being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering\naltitude\u2014how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all\nwhale-ships\u2019 standing orders, \u201cKeep your weather eye open, and sing out\nevery time.\u201d\n\nAnd let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of\nNantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with\nlean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who\noffers to ship with the Ph\u00e6don instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware\nof such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be\nkilled; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes\nround the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor\nare these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery\nfurnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded\nyoung men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking\nsentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches\nhimself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship,\nand in moody phrase ejaculates:\u2014\n\n\n\u201cRoll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand\nblubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.\u201d\n\n\n\nVery often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young\nphilosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient\n\u201cinterest\u201d in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost\nto all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would\nrather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young\nPlatonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are\nshort-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have\nleft their opera-glasses at home.\n\n\u201cWhy, thou monkey,\u201d said a harpooneer to one of these lads, \u201cwe\u2019ve been\ncruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale\nyet. Whales are scarce as hen\u2019s teeth whenever thou art up here.\u201d\nPerhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in\nthe far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of\nvacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending\ncadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity;\ntakes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep,\nblue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange,\nhalf-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every\ndimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him\nthe embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by\ncontinually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit\nebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space;\nlike Cranmer\u2019s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of\nevery shore the round globe over.\n\nThere is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a\ngently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from\nthe inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on\nye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your\nidentity comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And\nperhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled\nshriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no\nmore to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!\n\n\nCHAPTER 36.
