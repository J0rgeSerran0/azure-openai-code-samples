Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist,\nit hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping\nback into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for\nan instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of\nflakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the\nmarble trunk of the whale.\n\n\u201cGive way!\u201d cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to\nthe attack; but maddened by yesterday\u2019s fresh irons that corroded in\nhim, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell\nfrom heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad\nwhite forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;\nas head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more\nflailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two\nmates\u2019 boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows,\nbut leaving Ahab\u2019s almost without a scar.\n\nWhile Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the\nwhale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he\nshot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round\nand round to the fish\u2019s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in\nwhich, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of\nthe lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his\nsable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old\nAhab.\n\nThe harpoon dropped from his hand.\n\n\u201cBefooled, befooled!\u201d\u2014drawing in a long lean breath\u2014\u201cAye, Parsee! I see\nthee again.\u2014Aye, and thou goest before; and this, _this_ then is the\nhearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of\nthy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those\nboats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me;\nif not, Ahab is enough to die\u2014Down, men! the first thing that but\noffers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are\nnot other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.\u2014Where\u2019s the\nwhale? gone down again?\u201d\n\nBut he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the\ncorpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter\nhad been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again\nsteadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,\u2014which thus\nfar had been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the\npresent her headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his\nutmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight\npath in the sea.\n\n\u201cOh! Ahab,\u201d cried Starbuck, \u201cnot too late is it, even now, the third\nday, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that\nmadly seekest him!\u201d\n\nSetting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled\nto leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding\nby the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck\u2019s face as he\nleaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and\nfollow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards,\nhe saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three\nmast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats\nwhich had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in\nrepairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he\nsped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying\nthemselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all\nthis; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers\nseemed driving a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking\nthat the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to\nTashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another\nflag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.\n\nWhether fagged by the three days\u2019 running chase, and the resistance to\nhis swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some\nlatent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White\nWhale\u2019s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly\nnearing him once more; though indeed the whale\u2019s last start had not\nbeen so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves\nthe unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to\nthe boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades\nbecame jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at\nalmost every dip.\n\n\u201cHeed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
