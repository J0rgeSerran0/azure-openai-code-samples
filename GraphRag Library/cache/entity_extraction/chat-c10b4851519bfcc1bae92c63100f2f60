Hence, in whale-ships and\nmerchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and\nso, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in\nthe after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in\nthe captain\u2019s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with\nit.\n\nThough the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest\nof all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and\nthe community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high\nor low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their\ncommon luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and\nhard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a\nless rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind\nhow much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some\nprimitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious\nexternals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,\nand in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in\nwhich you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated\ngrandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as\nmuch outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the\nshabbiest of pilot-cloth.\n\nAnd though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least\ngiven to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage\nhe ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he\nrequired no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the\nquarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar\ncircumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he\naddressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or _in\nterrorem_, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means\nunobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.\n\nNor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind\nthose forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;\nincidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than\nthey were legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of\nhis brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested;\nthrough those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an\nirresistible dictatorship. For be a man\u2019s intellectual superiority what\nit will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over\nother men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and\nentrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base.\nThis it is, that for ever keeps God\u2019s true princes of the Empire from\nthe world\u2019s hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can\ngive, to those men who become famous more through their infinite\ninferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than\nthrough their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.\nSuch large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political\nsuperstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot\nimbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the case of\nNicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an\nimperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the\ntremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would\ndepict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing,\never forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one\nnow alluded to.\n\nBut Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket\ngrimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and\nKings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old\nwhale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings\nand housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it\nmust needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and\nfeatured in the unbodied air!\n\n\nCHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.\n\nIt is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale\nloaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord\nand master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking\nan observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on\nthe smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on\nthe upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the\ntidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But\npresently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the\ndeck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, \u201cDinner, Mr.\nStarbuck,\u201d disappears into the cabin.\n\nWhen the last echo of his sultan\u2019s step has died away, and Starbuck,\nthe first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then\nStarbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
