Mind what I said about the marchant\nservice\u2014don\u2019t aggravate me\u2014I won\u2019t have it. But let us understand each\nother. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel\ninclined for it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live\nwhale\u2019s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to\nbe got rid of, that is; which I don\u2019t take to be the fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find\nout by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to\nsee the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just\nstep forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back\nto me and tell me what ye see there.\u201d\n\nFor a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not\nknowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But\nconcentrating all his crow\u2019s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started\nme on the errand.\n\nGoing forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\nship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\npointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but\nexceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I\ncould see.\n\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s the report?\u201d said Peleg when I came back; \u201cwhat did ye\nsee?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot much,\u201d I replied\u2014\u201cnothing but water; considerable horizon though,\nand there\u2019s a squall coming up, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go\nround Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can\u2019t ye see the world where\nyou stand?\u201d\n\nI was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the\nPequod was as good a ship as any\u2014I thought the best\u2014and all this I now\nrepeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his\nwillingness to ship me.\n\n\u201cAnd thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\u201d he added\u2014\u201ccome\nalong with ye.\u201d And so saying, he led the way below deck into the\ncabin.\n\nSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\nsurprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with\nCaptain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other\nshares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd\nof old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;\neach owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a\nnail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in\nwhaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state\nstocks bringing in good interest.\n\nNow, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\nQuaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to\nthis day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the\npeculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by\nthings altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same\nQuakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They\nare fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\n\nSo that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\nScripture names\u2014a singularly common fashion on the island\u2014and in\nchildhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the\nQuaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\nadventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\nunoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\nunworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when\nthese things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a\nglobular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and\nseclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and\nbeneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think\nuntraditionally and independently; receiving all nature\u2019s sweet or\nsavage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding\nbreast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental\nadvantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language\u2014that man\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
