But nothing like this, in the present\ncase, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern;\nand the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair\nof overburdening panniers.\n\nMeantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale\u2019s head, and ever\nand anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own\nhand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his\nshadow; while, if the Parsee\u2019s shadow was there at all it seemed only\nto blend with, and lengthen Ahab\u2019s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish\nspeculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing\nthings.\n\n\nCHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale\u2019s Head\u2014Contrasted View.\n\nHere, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us\njoin them, and lay together our own.\n\nOf the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\nWhale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales\nregularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two\nextremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the external\ndifference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a\nhead of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod\u2019s side; and as we\nmay freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the\ndeck:\u2014where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to\nstudy practical cetology than here?\n\nIn the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\nthese heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a\ncertain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale\u2019s which the Right\nWhale\u2019s sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale\u2019s head.\nAs you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to\nhim, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this\ndignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the\nsummit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he\nis what the fishermen technically call a \u201cgrey-headed whale.\u201d\n\nLet us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads\u2014namely, the two\nmost important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the\nhead, and low down, near the angle of either whale\u2019s jaw, if you\nnarrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\nfancy to be a young colt\u2019s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\nmagnitude of the head.\n\nNow, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale\u2019s eyes, it is\nplain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\nthan he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale\u2019s\neyes corresponds to that of a man\u2019s ears; and you may fancy, for\nyourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects\nthrough your ears. You would find that you could only command some\nthirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;\nand about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking\nstraight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not\nbe able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from\nbehind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\nsame time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes\nthe front of a man\u2014what, indeed, but his eyes?\n\nMoreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\nare so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\nproduce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of\nthe whale\u2019s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of\nsolid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating\ntwo lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the\nimpressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,\nmust see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct\npicture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and\nnothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the\nworld from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with\nthe whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two\ndistinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the\nwhale\u2019s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and\nto be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.\n\nA curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\nvisual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a\nhint. So long as a man\u2019s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing\nis involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing\nwhatever objects are before him.
