In\nshape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a\nless rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and\ngentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises\nhave), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel\nhue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his\nside fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark\nin a ship\u2019s hull, called the \u201cbright waist,\u201d that line streaks him from\nstem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below.\nThe white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which\nmakes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a\nmeal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of\nthe common porpoise.\n\n  * * * * * *\n\nBeyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the\nPorpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the\nLeviathans of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,\nhalf-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by\nreputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate them by their\nfore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to\nfuture investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If\nany of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then\nhe can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his\nFolio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:\u2014The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk\nWhale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the\nCannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale;\nthe Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic,\nDutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists\nof uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I\nomit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them\nfor mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing.\n\nFinally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be\nhere, and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have\nkept my word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus\nunfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the\ncrane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small\nerections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true\nones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever\ncompleting anything. This whole book is but a draught\u2014nay, but the\ndraught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!\n\n\nCHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.\n\nConcerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place\nas any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising\nfrom the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown\nof course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\n\nThe large importance attached to the harpooneer\u2019s vocation is evinced\nby the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\nand more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the\nperson now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\nofficer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;\nusage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In\nthose days, the captain\u2019s authority was restricted to the navigation\nand general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting\ndepartment and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer\nreigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted\ntitle of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\nhis former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as\nsenior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain\u2019s more\ninferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the\nharpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since\nin the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the\nboat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling\nground) the command of the ship\u2019s deck is also his; therefore the grand\npolitical maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart\nfrom the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their\nprofessional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as\ntheir social equal.\n\nNow, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\nthis\u2014the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\nmerchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and\nso, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in\nthe after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in\nthe captain\u2019s cabin, and sleep\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
