So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward\nthere! Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!\u201d\n\nAnd thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other\nstubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew\nof the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the\nreceding Bachelor; but the Bachelor\u2019s men never heeding their gaze for\nthe lively revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the\ntaffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a\nsmall vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed\nthereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was\nfilled with Nantucket soundings.\n\n\nCHAPTER 116. The Dying Whale.\n\nNot seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune\u2019s favourites\nsail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the\nrushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed\nit with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor,\nwhales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.\n\nIt was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the\ncrimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky,\nsun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and\nsuch plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy\nair, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent\nvalleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned\nsailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.\n\nSoothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned\noff from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the\nnow tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm\nwhales dying\u2014the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring\u2014that\nstrange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab\nconveyed a wondrousness unknown before.\n\n\u201cHe turns and turns him to it,\u2014how slowly, but how steadfastly, his\nhomage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too\nworships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!\u2014Oh\nthat these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights.\nLook! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in\nthese most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks\nfurnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still\nrolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the\nNiger\u2019s unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith;\nbut see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it\nheads some other way.\n\n\u201cOh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded\nthy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas;\nthou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the\nwide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor\nhas this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round\nagain, without a lesson to me.\n\n\u201cOh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring,\nrainbowed jet!\u2014that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In\nvain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening\nsun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou,\ndarker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy\nunnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of\nonce living things, exhaled as air, but water now.\n\n\u201cThen hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild\nfowl finds his only rest.
