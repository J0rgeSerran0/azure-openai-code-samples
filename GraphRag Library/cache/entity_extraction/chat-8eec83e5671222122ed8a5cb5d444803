There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most\nabsurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;\u2014but what of that? Queequeg\nthought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;\nand there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let\nhim be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all\u2014Presbyterians and Pagans\nalike\u2014for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and\nsadly need mending.\n\nTowards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and\nrituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;\nbut no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.\n\u201cQueequeg,\u201d said I softly through the key-hole:\u2014all silent. \u201cI say,\nQueequeg! why don\u2019t you speak? It\u2019s I\u2014Ishmael.\u201d But all remained still\nas before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant\ntime; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through\nthe key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the\nkey-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see\npart of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing\nmore. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden\nshaft of Queequeg\u2019s harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous\nhad taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. That\u2019s strange,\nthought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he\nseldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside\nhere, and no possible mistake.\n\n\u201cQueequeg!\u2014Queequeg!\u201d\u2014all still. Something must have happened.\nApoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.\nRunning down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person\nI met\u2014the chamber-maid. \u201cLa! la!\u201d she cried, \u201cI thought something must\nbe the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was\nlocked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it\u2019s been just so silent ever\nsince. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your\nbaggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma\u2019am!\u2014Mistress! murder! Mrs.\nHussey! apoplexy!\u201d\u2014and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I\nfollowing.\n\nMrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a\nvinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation\nof attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy\nmeantime.\n\n\u201cWood-house!\u201d cried I, \u201cwhich way to it? Run for God\u2019s sake, and fetch\nsomething to pry open the door\u2014the axe!\u2014the axe! he\u2019s had a stroke;\ndepend upon it!\u201d\u2014and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs\nagain empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and\nvinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, young man?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet the axe! For God\u2019s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry\nit open!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook here,\u201d said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet,\nso as to have one hand free; \u201clook here; are you talking about prying\nopen any of my doors?\u201d\u2014and with that she seized my arm. \u201cWhat\u2019s the\nmatter with you? What\u2019s the matter with you, shipmate?\u201d\n\nIn as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand\nthe whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of\nher nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed\u2014\u201cNo! I haven\u2019t\nseen it since I put it there.\u201d Running to a little closet under the\nlanding of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that\nQueequeg\u2019s harpoon was missing. \u201cHe\u2019s killed himself,\u201d she cried. \u201cIt\u2019s\nunfort\u2019nate Stiggs done over again\u2014there goes another counterpane\u2014God\npity his poor mother!\u2014it will be the ruin of my house.
