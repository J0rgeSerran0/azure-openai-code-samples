The picture represents a Cape-Horner\nin a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its\nthree dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,\npurposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of\nimpaling himself upon the three mast-heads.\n\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\narray of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with\nglittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots\nof human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping\nround like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed\nmower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal\nand savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,\nhorrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances\nand harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With\nthis once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan\nSwain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that\nharpoon\u2014so like a corkscrew now\u2014was flung in Javan seas, and run away\nwith by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The\noriginal iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle\nsojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last\nwas found imbedded in the hump.\n\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way\u2014cut\nthrough what in old times must have been a great central chimney with\nfireplaces all round\u2014you enter the public room. A still duskier place\nis this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled\nplanks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft\u2019s\ncockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored\nold ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like\ntable covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities\ngathered from this wide world\u2019s remotest nooks. Projecting from the\nfurther angle of the room stands a dark-looking den\u2014the bar\u2014a rude\nattempt at a right whale\u2019s head. Be that how it may, there stands the\nvast arched bone of the whale\u2019s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost\ndrive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old\ndecanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,\nlike another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),\nbustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells\nthe sailors deliriums and death.\n\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true\ncylinders without\u2014within, the villanous green goggling glasses\ndeceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians\nrudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads\u2019 goblets. Fill to\n_this_ mark, and your charge is but a penny; to _this_ a penny more;\nand so on to the full glass\u2014the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp\ndown for a shilling.\n\nUpon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about\na table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_. I\nsought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with\na room, received for answer that his house was full\u2014not a bed\nunoccupied. \u201cBut avast,\u201d he added, tapping his forehead, \u201cyou haint no\nobjections to sharing a harpooneer\u2019s blanket, have ye? I s\u2019pose you are\ngoin\u2019 a-whalin\u2019, so you\u2019d better get used to that sort of thing.\u201d\n\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\never do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that\nif he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the\nharpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\nfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with\nthe half of any decent man\u2019s blanket.\n\n\u201cI thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?\u2014you want supper?\nSupper\u2019ll be ready directly.\u201d\n\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the\nBattery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with\nhis jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space\nbetween his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but\nhe didn\u2019t make much headway, I thought.\n\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\nadjoining room. It was cold as Iceland\u2014no fire at all\u2014the landlord said\nhe couldn\u2019t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a\nwinding sheet.
