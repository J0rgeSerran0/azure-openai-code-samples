It\u2019s the first foul wind\nI ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so\nbefore? it must be, he\u2019s lost his tiller.\u201d\n\nAs an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck\nload of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her\nway; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly\nturning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious\nwake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost\nthat fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.\n\n\u201cOnly wait a bit, old chap, and I\u2019ll give ye a sling for that wounded\narm,\u201d cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.\n\n\u201cMind he don\u2019t sling thee with it,\u201d cried Starbuck. \u201cGive way, or the\nGerman will have him.\u201d\n\nWith one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one\nfish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most\nvaluable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were\ngoing with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for\nthe time. At this juncture the Pequod\u2019s keels had shot by the three\nGerman boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,\nDerick\u2019s boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his\nforeign rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being\nalready so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron\nbefore they could completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he\nseemed quite confident that this would be the case, and occasionally\nwith a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats.\n\n\u201cThe ungracious and ungrateful dog!\u201d cried Starbuck; \u201che mocks and\ndares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes\nago!\u201d\u2014then in his old intense whisper\u2014\u201cGive way, greyhounds!

What d\u2019ye say,\nTashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces\nfor the honor of old Gayhead? What d\u2019ye say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI say, pull like god-dam,\u201d\u2014cried the Indian.\n\nFiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod\u2019s\nthree boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,\nmomentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the\nheadsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up\nproudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating\ncry of, \u201cThere she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down\nwith the Yarman! Sail over him!\u201d\n\nBut so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all\ntheir gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not\na righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the\nblade of his midship o\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
