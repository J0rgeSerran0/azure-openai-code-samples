Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never\nmore would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\nnevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask\nhelped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.\nLeast of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he\nthought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its\nclotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so\nlong a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and\ntherefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas!\nwas a butterless man!\n\nAnother thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask\nis the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask\u2019s dinner was badly\njammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;\nand yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb\neven, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small\nappetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask\nmust bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that\nday; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the\ndeck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever\nsince he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he\nhad never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less.\nFor what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal\nin him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed\nfrom my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of\nold-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before\nthe mast. There\u2019s the fruits of promotion now; there\u2019s the vanity of\nglory: there\u2019s the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any\nmere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask\u2019s\nofficial capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\nvengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\nthrough the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before\nawful Ahab.\n\nNow, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table\nin the Pequod\u2019s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted\norder to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was\nrestored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the\nthree harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary\nlegatees. They made a sort of temporary servants\u2019 hall of the high and\nmighty cabin.\n\nIn strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\ninvisible domineerings of the captain\u2019s table, was the entire care-free\nlicense and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior\nfellows the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid\nof the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed\ntheir food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined\nlike lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading\nwith spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that\nto fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale\nDough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly\nquarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he\ndid not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an\nungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,\nharpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted\nDough-Boy\u2019s memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head\ninto a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand,\nbegan laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was\nnaturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this\nbread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital\nnurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab,\nand the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages,\nDough-Boy\u2019s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after\nseeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he\nwould escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and\nfearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was\nover.\n\nIt was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\nhis filed teeth to the Indian\u2019s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on\nthe floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the\nlow carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low\ncabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in\na ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,\nnot to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively\nsmall mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so\nbroad, baronial, and superb a\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
