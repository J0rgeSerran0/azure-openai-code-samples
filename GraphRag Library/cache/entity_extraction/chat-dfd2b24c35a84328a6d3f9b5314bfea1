It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor\nsuch a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague,\nwhen the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable\nindeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to\nmoor alongside of it. Yet are there those who will still do it;\nnotwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of\na very inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of\nattar-of-rose.\n\nComing still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman\nhad a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of\na nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those\nproblematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of\nprodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies\nalmost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the\nproper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up\nhis nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted\nwhales in general.\n\nThe Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he\nrecognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were\nknotted round the tail of one of these whales.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty fellow, now,\u201d he banteringly laughed, standing in the\nship\u2019s bows, \u201cthere\u2019s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes\nof Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering\ntheir boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes,\nand sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of\ntallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they\nwill get won\u2019t be enough to dip the Captain\u2019s wick into; aye, we all\nknow these things; but look ye, here\u2019s a Crappo that is content with\nour leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too\nwith scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there.\nPoor devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let\u2019s make him a\npresent of a little oil for dear charity\u2019s sake. For what oil he\u2019ll get\nfrom that drugged whale there, wouldn\u2019t be fit to burn in a jail; no,\nnot in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I\u2019ll agree to\nget more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours,\nthan he\u2019ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of\nit, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes,\nambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It\u2019s worth\ntrying. Yes, I\u2019m for it;\u201d and so saying he started for the\nquarter-deck.\n\nBy this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether\nor no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope\nof escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin,\nStubb now called his boat\u2019s crew, and pulled off for the stranger.\nDrawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the\nfanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in\nthe likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for\nthorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole\nterminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon\nher head boards, in large gilt letters, he read \u201cBouton de\nRose,\u201d\u2014Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this\naromatic ship.\n\nThough Stubb did not understand the _Bouton_ part of the inscription,\nyet the word _rose_, and the bulbous figure-head put together,\nsufficiently explained the whole to him.\n\n\u201cA wooden rose-bud, eh?\u201d he cried with his hand to his nose, \u201cthat will\ndo very well; but how like all creation it smells!\u201d\n\nNow in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he\nhad to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close\nto the blasted whale; and so talk over it.\n\nArrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\nbawled\u2014\u201cBouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that\nspeak English?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be\nthe chief-mate.\n\n\u201cWell, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?\u201d\n\n\u201c_What_ whale?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe _White_ Whale\u2014a Sperm Whale\u2014Moby Dick, have ye seen him?\n\n\u201cNever heard of such a whale.
