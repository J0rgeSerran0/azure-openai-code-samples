It had previously come\nto me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished\nbone of the sperm whale\u2019s jaw. \u201cAye, he was dismasted off Japan,\u201d said\nthe old Gay-Head Indian once; \u201cbut like his dismasted craft, he shipped\nanother mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of \u2019em.\u201d\n\nI was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of\nthe Pequod\u2019s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\nthere was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\nplank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\nholding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\nbeyond the ship\u2019s ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest\nfortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and\nfearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor\ndid his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest\ngestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not\npainful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not\nonly that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion\nin his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some\nmighty woe.\n\nEre long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.\nBut after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either\nstanding in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or\nheavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to\ngrow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if,\nwhen the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry\nbleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it\ncame to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,\nfor all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he\nseemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only\nmaking a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling\npreparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so\nthat there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite\nAhab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that\nlayer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose\nthe loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.\n\nNevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\npleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him\nfrom his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and\nMay, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest,\nruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some\nfew green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did,\nin the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish\nair. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,\nwhich, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.\n\n\nCHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.\n\nSome days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went\nrolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost\nperpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the\nTropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,\nredundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped\nup\u2014flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights\nseemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely\npride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted\nsuns! For sleeping man, \u2019twas hard to choose between such winsome days\nand such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning\nweather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward\nworld. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild\nhours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice\nmost forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more\nand more they wrought on Ahab\u2019s texture.\n\nOld age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less\nman has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,\nthe old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the\nnight-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he\nseemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits\nwere more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. \u201cIt feels\nlike going down into one\u2019s tomb,\u201d\u2014he would mutter to himself\u2014\u201cfor an\nold captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
