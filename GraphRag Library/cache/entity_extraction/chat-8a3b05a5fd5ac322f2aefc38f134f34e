Meantime, of the broken\nkeel of Ahab\u2019s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while\nstill as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his\nscuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its\ndial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.\n\n\nCHAPTER 135.

And still this hair is growing\nnow; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it\u2019s like\nthat sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy\nclefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow\nit; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the\ntossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this\nthrough prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and\nventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.\nOut upon it!\u2014it\u2019s tainted.
