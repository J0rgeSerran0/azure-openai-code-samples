The Fossil Whale.\n\nFrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon\nto enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not\ncompress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial\nfolio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and\nthe yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic\ninvolutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables\nand hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a\nline-of-battle-ship.\n\nSince I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to\napprove myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not\noverlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him\nout to the uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him\nin most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now\nremains to magnify him in an arch\u00e6ological, fossiliferous, and\nantediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature than the\nLeviathan\u2014to an ant or a flea\u2014such portly terms might justly be deemed\nunwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the case\nis altered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest\nwords of the dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been\nconvenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, I have\ninvariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson, expressly purchased\nfor that purpose; because that famous lexicographer\u2019s uncommon personal\nbulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author\nlike me.\n\nOne often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,\nthough it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of\nthis Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard\ncapitals. Give me a condor\u2019s quill! Give me Vesuvius\u2019 crater for an\ninkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my\nthoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their\noutreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole\ncircle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and\nmastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas\nof empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding\nits suburbs. Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and\nliberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you\nmust choose a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be\nwritten on the flea, though many there be who have tried it.\n\nEre entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my\ncredentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I\nhave been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and\nwells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by\nway of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the\nearlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now\nalmost completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are\ncalled the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate\nintercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose\nremote posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil\nWhales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the\nlast preceding the superficial formations. And though none of them\nprecisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet\nsufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking\nrank as Cetacean fossils.\n\nDetached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones\nand skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals,\nbeen found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England,\nin Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\nAmong the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the\nyear 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street\nopening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones\ndisinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon\u2019s\ntime. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some\nutterly unknown Leviathanic species.\n\nBut by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost\ncomplete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842,\non the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken\ncredulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the\nfallen angels. The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and\nbestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of\nit being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned\nout that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed\nspecies. A significant illustration of the fact, again and again\nrepeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but\nlittle clue to the shape of his fully invested body. So Owen\nrechristened the monster\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
