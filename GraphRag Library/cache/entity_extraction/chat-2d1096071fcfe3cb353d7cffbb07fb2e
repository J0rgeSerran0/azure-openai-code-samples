But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the\nhard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At\nlength one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made\nbold to speak,\n\n\u201cPlease, sir, who is the Lord Warden?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Duke.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all\nthat to go to the Duke\u2019s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our\npains but our blisters?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of\ngetting a livelihood?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of\nthis whale.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\n\nIn a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of\nWellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular\nlights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be\ndeemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman\nof the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to\ntake the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To\nwhich my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)\nthat he had already done so, and received the money, and would be\nobliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend\ngentleman) would decline meddling with other people\u2019s business. Is this\nthe still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three\nkingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?\n\nIt will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke\nto the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs\ninquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested\nwith that right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon\ngives us the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs\nto the King and Queen, \u201cbecause of its superior excellence.\u201d And by the\nsoundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such\nmatters.\n\nBut why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason\nfor that, ye lawyers!\n\nIn his treatise on \u201cQueen-Gold,\u201d or Queen-pinmoney, an old King\u2019s Bench\nauthor, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: \u201cYe tail is ye Queen\u2019s,\nthat ye Queen\u2019s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.\u201d Now this\nwas written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or\nRight whale was largely used in ladies\u2019 bodices. But this same bone is\nnot in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a\nsagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be\npresented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.\n\nThere are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers\u2014the whale\nand the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and\nnominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown\u2019s ordinary revenue. I\nknow not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by\ninference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same\nway as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head\npeculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be\nhumorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there\nseems a reason in all things, even in law.\n\n\nCHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.\n\n\u201cIn vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this\nLeviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.\u201d _Sir T. Browne,\nV.E._\n\nIt was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when\nwe were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the\nmany noses on the Pequod\u2019s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than\nthe three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell\nwas smelt in the sea.\n\n\u201cI will bet something now,\u201d said Stubb, \u201cthat somewhere hereabouts are\nsome of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they\nwould keel up before long.\u201d\n\nPresently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance\nlay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must\nbe alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours\nfrom his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that\ncircled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the\nwhale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that\nis, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an\nunappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor\nsuch a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague,\nwhen the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable\nindeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to\nmoor\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
