So, so; it does pinch some.\n\nOh, sir, it will break bones\u2014beware, beware!\n\nNo fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery\nworld that can hold, man. What\u2019s Prometheus about there?\u2014the\nblacksmith, I mean\u2014what\u2019s he about?\n\nHe must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.\n\nRight. It\u2019s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a\nfierce red flame there!\n\nAye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.\n\nUm-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old\nGreek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a\nblacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what\u2019s made in fire must\nproperly belong to fire; and so hell\u2019s probable. How the soot flies!\nThis must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter,\nwhen he\u2019s through with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel\nshoulder-blades; there\u2019s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.\n\nSir?\n\nHold; while Prometheus is about it, I\u2019ll order a complete man after a\ndesirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest\nmodelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to \u2019em, to stay\nin one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all,\nbrass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let\nme see\u2014shall I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on\ntop of his head to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.\n\nNow, what\u2019s he speaking about, and who\u2019s he speaking to, I should like\nto know? Shall I keep standing here? (_aside_).\n\n\u2019Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here\u2019s one. No,\nno, no; I must have a lantern.\n\nHo, ho! That\u2019s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.\n\nWhat art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man?\nThrusted light is worse than presented pistols.\n\nI thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.\n\nCarpenter? why that\u2019s\u2014but no;\u2014a very tidy, and, I may say, an extremely\ngentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;\u2014or would\u2019st\nthou rather work in clay?\n\nSir?\u2014Clay? clay, sir? That\u2019s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.\n\nThe fellow\u2019s impious! What art thou sneezing about?\n\nBone is rather dusty, sir.\n\nTake the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under\nliving people\u2019s noses.\n\nSir?\u2014oh! ah!\u2014I guess so;\u2014yes\u2014oh, dear!\n\nLook ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good\nworkmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for\nthy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall\nnevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that\nis, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst\nthou not drive that old Adam away?\n\nTruly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard\nsomething curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never\nentirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still\npricking him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?\n\nIt is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once\nwas; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the\nsoul. Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to\na hair, do I. Is\u2019t a riddle?\n\nI should humbly call it a poser, sir.\n\nHist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing\nmay not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where\nthou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most\nsolitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don\u2019t\nspeak! And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be\nnow so long dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the\nfiery pains of hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!\n\nGood Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over\nagain; I think I didn\u2019t carry a small figure, sir.\n\nLook ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.\u2014How long before the\nleg is done?\n\nPerhaps an hour, sir.\n\nBungle away at it then, and bring it to me (_turns to go_). Oh, Life!\nHere I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this\nblockhead for a bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal\ninter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers.
