Immediately he was\nrecognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation\nwas exchanged.\n\n\u201cWhere was he?\u2014not killed!\u2014not killed!\u201d cried Ahab, closely advancing.\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d\n\nIt seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,\nwhile three of the stranger\u2019s boats were engaged with a shoal of\nwhales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and\nwhile they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head\nof Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to\nleeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat\u2014a reserved one\u2014had been\ninstantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this\nfourth boat\u2014the swiftest keeled of all\u2014seemed to have succeeded in\nfastening\u2014at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell\nanything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat;\nand then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing\nmore; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have\nindefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. There was\nsome apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals\nwere placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her\nthree far to windward boats\u2014ere going in quest of the fourth one in the\nprecisely opposite direction\u2014the ship had not only been necessitated to\nleave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to\nincrease her distance from it. But the rest of her crew being at last\nsafe aboard, she crowded all sail\u2014stunsail on stunsail\u2014after the\nmissing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every\nother man aloft on the look-out. But though when she had thus sailed a\nsufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when\nlast seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all\naround her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again\npaused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing\ntill daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been\nseen.\n\nThe story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his\nobject in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his\nown in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles\napart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.\n\n\u201cI will wager something now,\u201d whispered Stubb to Flask, \u201cthat some one\nin that missing boat wore off that Captain\u2019s best coat; mayhap, his\nwatch\u2014he\u2019s so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two\npious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height\nof the whaling season? See, Flask, only see how pale he looks\u2014pale in\nthe very buttons of his eyes\u2014look\u2014it wasn\u2019t the coat\u2014it must have been\nthe\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy boy, my own boy is among them. For God\u2019s sake\u2014I beg, I\nconjure\u201d\u2014here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had\nbut icily received his petition. \u201cFor eight-and-forty hours let me\ncharter your ship\u2014I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it\u2014if\nthere be no other way\u2014for eight-and-forty hours only\u2014only that\u2014you\nmust, oh, you must, and you _shall_ do this thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis son!\u201d cried Stubb, \u201coh, it\u2019s his son he\u2019s lost! I take back the\ncoat and watch\u2014what says Ahab? We must save that boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s drowned with the rest on \u2019em, last night,\u201d said the old Manx\nsailor standing behind them; \u201cI heard; all of ye heard their spirits.\u201d\n\nNow, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel\u2019s\nthe more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the\nCaptain\u2019s sons among the number of the missing boat\u2019s crew; but among\nthe number of the other boat\u2019s crews, at the same time, but on the\nother hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the\nchase, there had been still another son; as that for a time, the\nwretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity;\nwhich was only solved for him by his chief mate\u2019s instinctively\nadopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies,\nthat is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to\npick up the majority first. But the captain, for some unknown\nconstitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not\ntill forced to it by Ahab\u2019s iciness did he allude to his one yet\nmissing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the\nearnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer\u2019s paternal love, had\nthus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a\nvocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it\nunfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such\ntender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years\u2019 voyage\nin some\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
