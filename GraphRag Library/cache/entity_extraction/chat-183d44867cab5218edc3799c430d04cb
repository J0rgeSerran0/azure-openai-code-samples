Heed it well, ye Pantheists!\n\n\nCHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.\n\n(_Enter Ahab: Then, all._)\n\nIt was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning\nshortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the\ncabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that\nhour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in\nthe garden.\n\nSoon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old\nrounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over\ndented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did\nyou fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,\nyou would see still stranger foot-prints\u2014the foot-prints of his one\nunsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\n\nBut on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his\nnervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his\nthought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the\nmain-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought\nturn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely\npossessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of\nevery outer movement.\n\n\u201cD\u2019ye mark him, Flask?\u201d whispered Stubb; \u201cthe chick that\u2019s in him pecks\nthe shell. \u2019Twill soon be out.\u201d\n\nThe hours wore on;\u2014Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the\ndeck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.\n\nIt drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the\nbulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and\nwith one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody\naft.\n\n\u201cSir!\u201d said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on\nship-board except in some extraordinary case.\n\n\u201cSend everybody aft,\u201d repeated Ahab. \u201cMast-heads, there! come down!\u201d\n\nWhen the entire ship\u2019s company were assembled, and with curious and not\nwholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike\nthe weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly\nglancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,\nstarted from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him\nresumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched\nhat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among\nthe men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have\nsummoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat.\nBut this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:\u2014\n\n\u201cWhat do ye do when ye see a whale, men?\u201d\n\n\u201cSing out for him!\u201d was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed\nvoices.\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the\nhearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically\nthrown them.\n\n\u201cAnd what do ye next, men?\u201d\n\n\u201cLower away, and after him!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what tune is it ye pull to, men?\u201d\n\n\u201cA dead whale or a stove boat!\u201d\n\nMore and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the\ncountenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to\ngaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they\nthemselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.\n\nBut, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his\npivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,\nalmost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:\u2014\n\n\u201cAll ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white\nwhale. Look ye! d\u2019ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?\u201d\u2014holding up a\nbroad bright coin to the sun\u2014\u201cit is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D\u2019ye\nsee it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.\u201d\n\nWhile the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\nslowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\nto heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly\nhumming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\ninarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his\nvitality in him.\n\nReceiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast\nwith the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the\nother, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: \u201cWhosoever of ye raises\nme a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;\nwhosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes\npunctured in his starboard fluke\u2014look ye, whosoever of ye raises me\nthat same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!\u201d\n\n\u201cHuzza! huzza!\u201d cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
