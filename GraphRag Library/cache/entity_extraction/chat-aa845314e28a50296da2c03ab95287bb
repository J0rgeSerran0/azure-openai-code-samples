It was an admirable artistic exploit,\nrarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as\nthis Leviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt\nthis Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian\ncoast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast\nskeleton of a whale, which the city\u2019s legends and all the inhabitants\nasserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew.\nWhen the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in\ntriumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in this\nstory, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.\n\nAkin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda\u2014indeed, by some supposed\nto be indirectly derived from it\u2014is that famous story of St. George and\nthe Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many\nold chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and\noften stand for each other. \u201cThou art as a lion of the waters, and as a\ndragon of the sea,\u201d saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in\ntruth, some versions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it\nwould much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but\nencountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle\nwith the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only\na Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march\nboldly up to a whale.\n\nLet not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the\ncreature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely\nrepresented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted\non land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance\nof those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists;\nand considering that as in Perseus\u2019 case, St. George\u2019s whale might have\ncrawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal\nridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;\nbearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible\nwith the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to\nhold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself.\nIn fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story\nwill fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines,\nDagon by name; who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse\u2019s\nhead and both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the\nstump or fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble\nstamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by\ngood rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most\nnoble order of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights of that\nhonorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do\nwith a whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer\nwith disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we\nare much better entitled to St. George\u2019s decoration than they.\n\nWhether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long\nremained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that\nantique Crockett and Kit Carson\u2014that brawny doer of rejoicing good\ndeeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that\nstrictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere\nappears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from\nthe inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary\nwhaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I\nclaim him for one of our clan.\n\nBut, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of\nHercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more\nancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice vers\u00e2; certainly\nthey are very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not the\nprophet?\n\nNor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole\nroll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like\nroyal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in\nnothing short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental\nstory is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread\nVishnoo, one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives\nus this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;\u2014Vishnoo, who, by the first\nof his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified\nthe whale. When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved\nto recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave\nbirth to Vishnoo,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
