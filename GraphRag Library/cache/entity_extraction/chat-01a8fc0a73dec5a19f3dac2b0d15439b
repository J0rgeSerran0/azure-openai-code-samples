He knew,\nfor example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was\nover Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual\nman any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual\nmastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in\na sort of corporeal relation. Starbuck\u2019s body and Starbuck\u2019s coerced\nwill were Ahab\u2019s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck\u2019s brain;\nstill he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred\nhis captain\u2019s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself\nfrom it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would\nelapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck\nwould ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his\ncaptain\u2019s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial\ninfluences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle\ninsanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly\nmanifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing\nthat, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that\nstrange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the\nfull terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure\nbackground (for few men\u2019s courage is proof against protracted\nmeditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night\nwatches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of\nthan Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had\nhailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are\nmore or less capricious and unreliable\u2014they live in the varying outer\nweather, and they inhale its fickleness\u2014and when retained for any\nobject remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and\npassion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary\ninterests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily\nsuspended for the final dash.\n\nNor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion\nmankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.\nThe permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought\nAhab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the\nhearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even\nbreeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for\nthe love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food\nfor their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and\nchivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two\nthousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without\ncommitting burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious\nperquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final\nand romantic object\u2014that final and romantic object, too many would have\nturned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of\nall hopes of cash\u2014aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some\nmonths go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this\nsame quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would\nsoon cashier Ahab.\n\nNor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related\nto Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps\nsomewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the\nPequod\u2019s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he\nhad indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of\nusurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew\nif so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further\nobedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From\neven the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible\nconsequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must\nof course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection\ncould only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,\nbacked by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute\natmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be\nsubjected to.\n\nFor all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be\nverbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good\ndegree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod\u2019s\nvoyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force\nhimself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general\npursuit of his profession.\n\nBe all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three\nmast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit\nreporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.\n\n\nCHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.\n\nIt was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging\nabout the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters.\nQueequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,\nfor an additional lashing to our boat.
