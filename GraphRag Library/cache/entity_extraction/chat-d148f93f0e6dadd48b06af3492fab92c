Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness\nof all earthly effort.\n\nGaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little\nMoss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his\nsnortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!\u2014how I spurned that turnpike\nearth!\u2014that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish\nheels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea\nwhich will permit no records.\n\nAt the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.\nHis dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed\nteeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to\nthe blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.\nSideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a\nwire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes.\nSo full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging\nbowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of\nthe passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow\nbeings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything\nmore dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies\nand bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come\nfrom the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these\nyoung saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bumpkin\u2019s\nhour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught\nhim in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength,\nsent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern\nin mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet,\nwhile Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe\nand passed it to me for a puff.\n\n\u201cCapting! Capting!\u201d yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;\n\u201cCapting, Capting, here\u2019s the devil.\u201d\n\n\u201cHallo, _you_ sir,\u201d cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking\nup to Queequeg, \u201cwhat in thunder do you mean by that? Don\u2019t you know\nyou might have killed that chap?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat him say?\u201d said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\n\n\u201cHe say,\u201d said I, \u201cthat you came near kill-e that man there,\u201d pointing\nto the still shivering greenhorn.\n\n\u201cKill-e,\u201d cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly\nexpression of disdain, \u201cah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e\nso small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook you,\u201d roared the Captain, \u201cI\u2019ll kill-e _you_, you cannibal, if\nyou try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.\u201d\n\nBut it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to\nmind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted\nthe weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to\nside, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor\nfellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all\nhands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,\nseemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in\none ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of\nsnapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable\nof being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing\nthe boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the\nmidst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and\ncrawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured\none end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso,\ncaught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next\njerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was\nrun into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern\nboat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long\nliving arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming\nlike a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by\nturns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I\nlooked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.\nThe greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the\nwater, Queequeg, now took an instant\u2019s glance around him, and seeming\nto see just how matters were, d\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
