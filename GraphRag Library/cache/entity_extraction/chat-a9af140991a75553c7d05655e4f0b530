I say, tell Quohog\nthere\u2014what\u2019s that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great\nanchor, what a harpoon he\u2019s got there! looks like good stuff that; and\nhe handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did\nyou ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a\nfish?\u201d\n\nWithout saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon\nthe bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats\nhanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his\nharpoon, cried out in some such way as this:\u2014\n\n\u201cCap\u2019ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,\nspose him one whale eye, well, den!\u201d and taking sharp aim at it, he\ndarted the iron right over old Bildad\u2019s broad brim, clean across the\nship\u2019s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, \u201cspos-ee him whale-e\neye; why, dad whale dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuick, Bildad,\u201d said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close\nvicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin\ngangway. \u201cQuick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship\u2019s papers. We must\nhave Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye,\nQuohog, we\u2019ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that\u2019s more than ever was\ngiven a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.\u201d\n\nSo down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon\nenrolled among the same ship\u2019s company to which I myself belonged.\n\nWhen all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for\nsigning, he turned to me and said, \u201cI guess, Quohog there don\u2019t know\nhow to write, does he?
