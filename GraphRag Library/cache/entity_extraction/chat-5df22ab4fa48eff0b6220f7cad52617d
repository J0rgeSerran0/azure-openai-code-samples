But skilfully man\u0153uvred, incessantly\nwheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while\neluded him; though, at times, but by a plank\u2019s breadth; while all the\ntime, Ahab\u2019s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.\n\nBut at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed\nand recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three\nlines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,\nwarped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now\nfor a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more\ntremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more\nline: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again\u2014hoping\nthat way to disencumber it of some snarls\u2014when lo!\u2014a sight more savage\nthan the embattled teeth of sharks!\n\nCaught and twisted\u2014corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons\nand lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing\nand dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab\u2019s boat. Only one\nthing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached\nwithin\u2014through\u2014and then, without\u2014the rays of steel; dragged in the line\nbeyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering\nthe rope near the chocks\u2014dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into\nthe sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a\nsudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so\ndoing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask\ntowards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a\nsurf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a\nboiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of\nthe wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly\nstirred bowl of punch.\n\nWhile the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after\nthe revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while\naslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching\nhis legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was\nlustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old\nman\u2019s line\u2014now parting\u2014admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to\nrescue whom he could;\u2014in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand\nconcreted perils,\u2014Ahab\u2019s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards\nHeaven by invisible wires,\u2014as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly\nfrom the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its\nbottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell\nagain\u2014gunwale downwards\u2014and Ahab and his men struggled out from under\nit, like seals from a sea-side cave.\n\nThe first uprising momentum of the whale\u2014modifying its direction as he\nstruck the surface\u2014involuntarily launched him along it, to a little\ndistance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his\nback to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from\nside to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or\ncrumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and\ncame sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work\nfor that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the\nocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his\nleeward way at a traveller\u2019s methodic pace.\n\nAs before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\ncame bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\nfloating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,\nand safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists,\nand ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;\ninextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these\nwere there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen\nany one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly\nclinging to his boat\u2019s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy\nfloat; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day\u2019s mishap.\n\nBut when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as\ninstead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of\nStarbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory\nleg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.\n\n\u201cAye, aye, Starbuck, \u2019tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he\nwill; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ferrule has not stood, sir,\u201d said the carpenter, now coming up; \u201cI\nput good work into that leg.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut no bones broken, sir, I hope,\u201d said Stubb with true concern.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
