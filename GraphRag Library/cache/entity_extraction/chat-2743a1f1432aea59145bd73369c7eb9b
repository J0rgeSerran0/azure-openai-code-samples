For\neven when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with\nhis elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary\u2019s in the desert; even then,\nthe whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a\nblazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with\nrain.\n\nNor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the\nprecise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering\ninto it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to\nthis fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into\nslight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will\noften happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of\nthe thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer\ncontact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or\notherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.\nWherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to\nevade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt\nit, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind\nyou. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is\nto let this deadly spout alone.\n\nStill, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My\nhypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides\nother reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations\ntouching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I\naccount him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed\nfact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other\nwhales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am\nconvinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as\nPlato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes\nup a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep\nthoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the\ncuriosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected\nthere, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over\nmy head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep\nthought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an\nAugust noon; this seems an additional argument for the above\nsupposition.\n\nAnd how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\nbehold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild\nhead overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable\ncontemplations, and that vapor\u2014as you will sometimes see it\u2014glorified\nby a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.\nFor, d\u2019ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate\nvapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my\nmind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a\nheavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;\nbut doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of\nall things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this\ncombination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who\nregards them both with equal eye.\n\n\nCHAPTER 86. The Tail.\n\nOther poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,\nand the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial,\nI celebrate a tail.\n\nReckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale\u2019s tail to begin at that point\nof the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises\nupon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet.\nThe compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat\npalms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in\nthickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap,\nthen sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy\nbetween. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely\ndefined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost\nexpansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed\ntwenty feet across.\n\nThe entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\ninto it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:\u2014upper,\nmiddle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long\nand horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\ncrosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as\nanything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman\nwalls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin\ncourse\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
