The second\nEmir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the\nmain brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important\nrope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid \u201cDinner,\nMr. Flask,\u201d follows after his predecessors.\n\nBut the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\nseems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all\nsorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his\nshoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right\nover the Grand Turk\u2019s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching\nhis cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so\nfar at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other\nprocessions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into\nthe cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,\nthen, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab\u2019s presence,\nin the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.\n\nIt is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\nartificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck\nsome officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and\ndefyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those\nvery officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that\nsame commander\u2019s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say\ndeprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the\ntable; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this\ndifference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of\nBabylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,\ntherein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he\nwho in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own\nprivate dinner-table of invited guests, that man\u2019s unchallenged power\nand dominion of individual influence for the time; that man\u2019s royalty\nof state transcends Belshazzar\u2019s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest.\nWho has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be C\u00e6sar.\nIt is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.\nNow, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a\nship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that\npeculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.\n\nOver his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion\non the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still\ndeferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be\nserved. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,\nthere seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,\ntheir intent eyes all fastened upon the old man\u2019s knife, as he carved\nthe chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they\nwould have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even\nupon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his\nknife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab\nthereby motioned Starbuck\u2019s plate towards him, the mate received his\nmeat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little\nstarted if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed\nit noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like\nthe Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor\nprofoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals\nwere somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old\nAhab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief\nit was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold\nbelow. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy\nof this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef;\nhis would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help\nhimself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the\nfirst degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never\nmore would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\nnevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask\nhelped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.\nLeast of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.
