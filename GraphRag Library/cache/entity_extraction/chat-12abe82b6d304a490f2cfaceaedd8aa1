He sees no black sky and raging sea,\nfeels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far\nrush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving\nthe seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides\nof the ship\u2014a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast\nasleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead\near, \u2018What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!\u2019 Startled from his lethargy\nby that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the\ndeck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he\nis sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave\nafter wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs\nroaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet\nafloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the\nsteep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing\nbowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the\ntormented deep.\n\n\u201cTerrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his\ncringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The\nsailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,\nand at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to\nhigh Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this\ngreat tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah\u2019s; that discovered, then\nhow furiously they mob him with their questions. \u2018What is thine\noccupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now,\nmy shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask\nhim who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer\nto those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put\nby them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard\nhand of God that is upon him.\n\n\u201c\u2018I am a Hebrew,\u2019 he cries\u2014and then\u2014\u2018I fear the Lord the God of Heaven\nwho hath made the sea and the dry land!\u2019 Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well\nmightest thou fear the Lord God _then!_ Straightway, he now goes on to\nmake a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more\nappalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating\nGod for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his\ndeserts,\u2014when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him\nforth into the sea, for he knew that for _his_ sake this great tempest\nwas upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means\nto save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder;\nthen, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not\nunreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.\n\n\u201cAnd now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;\nwhen instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea\nis still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water\nbehind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless\ncommotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into\nthe yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory\nteeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed\nunto the Lord out of the fish\u2019s belly. But observe his prayer, and\nlearn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and\nwail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is\njust. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with\nthis, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards\nHis holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance;\nnot clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing\nto God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance\nof him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah\nbefore you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a\nmodel for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it\nlike Jonah.\u201d\n\nWhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,\nslanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,\nwhen describing Jonah\u2019s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.\nHis deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed\nthe warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from\noff his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his\nsimple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.\n\nThere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the\nleaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with\nclosed eyes, for the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
