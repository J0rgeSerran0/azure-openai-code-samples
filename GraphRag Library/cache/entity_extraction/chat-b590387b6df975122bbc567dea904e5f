And that the Egyptians were a\nnation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general\nbelief among arch\u00e6ologists, that the first pyramids were founded for\nastronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar\nstair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with\nprodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were\nwont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the\nlook-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing\nin sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times,\nwho built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole\nlatter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the\nground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a\ndauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his\nplace by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing\neverything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern\nstanders-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\nand bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\nare still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\ndiscovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of\nthe column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and\nfifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\nwhether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great\nWashington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\nBaltimore, and like one of Hercules\u2019 pillars, his column marks that\npoint of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral\nNelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\nTrafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\ntoken is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\nsmoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\nNelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to\nbefriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;\nhowever it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the\nthick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be\nshunned.\n\nIt may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\nstanders of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not\nso, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\nhistorian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,\nthat in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly\nlaunched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected\nlofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by\nmeans of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house.\nA few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New\nZealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned\nboats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we\nthen to the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The\nthree mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen\ntaking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other\nevery two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly\npleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is\ndelightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks,\nstriding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while\nbeneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters\nof the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous\nColossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of\nthe sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship\nindolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you\ninto languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime\nuneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras\nwith startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into\nunnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt\nsecurities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what\nyou shall have for dinner\u2014for all your meals for three years and more\nare snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.\n\nIn one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years\u2019\nvoyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the\nmast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be\ndeplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion\nof the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
