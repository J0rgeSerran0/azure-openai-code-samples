A\nsound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven\nghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.\n\nStarted from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and\nhooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a\nflooded world. \u201cI have dreamed it again,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cOf the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor\ncoffin can be thine?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who are hearsed that die on the sea?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two\nhearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by\nmortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in\nAmerica.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:\u2014a hearse and its plumes\nfloating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a\nsight we shall not soon see.\u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what was that saying about thyself?\u201d\n\n\u201cThough it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when thou art so gone before\u2014if that ever befall\u2014then ere I can\nfollow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?\u2014Was it not so?\nWell, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here two\npledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake another pledge, old man,\u201d said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up\nlike fire-flies in the gloom\u2014\u201cHemp only can kill thee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gallows, ye mean.\u2014I am immortal then, on land and on sea,\u201d cried\nAhab, with a laugh of derision;\u2014\u201cImmortal on land and on sea!\u201d\n\nBoth were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the\nslumbering crew arose from the boat\u2019s bottom, and ere noon the dead\nwhale was brought to the ship.\n\n\nCHAPTER 118. The Quadrant.\n\nThe season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,\ncoming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would\nostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to\nthe braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed\non the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship\u2019s\nprow for the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon\nhigh noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was\nabout taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his\nlatitude.\n\nNow, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of\neffulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing\nfocus of the glassy ocean\u2019s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks\nlacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this\nnakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of\nGod\u2019s throne. Well that Ahab\u2019s quadrant was furnished with coloured\nglasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging\nhis seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his\nastrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that\nposture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun\nshould gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention\nwas absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship\u2019s deck,\nand with face thrown up like Ahab\u2019s, was eyeing the same sun with him;\nonly the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was\nsubdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired\nobservation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab\nsoon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then\nfalling into a moment\u2019s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and\nmurmured to himself: \u201cThou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou\ntellest me truly where I _am_\u2014but canst thou cast the least hint where\nI _shall_ be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is\nthis moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be\neyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now\nbeholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally beholding\nthe objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!\u201d\n\nThen gazing at his\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
