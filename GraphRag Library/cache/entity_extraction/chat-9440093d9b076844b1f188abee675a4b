From having the baleen in his mouth, the\nFin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic\nspecies denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of\nthese so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several\nvarieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales\nand beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed\nwhales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen\u2019s names for a few sorts.\n\nIn connection with this appellative of \u201cWhalebone whales,\u201d it is of\ngreat importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be\nconvenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is\nin vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded\nupon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that\nthose marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to\nafford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other\ndetached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.\nHow then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose\npeculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,\nwithout any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in\nother and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the\nhumpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.\nThen, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these\nhas baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the\nsame with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales,\nthey form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of\nthem detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all\ngeneral methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one\nof the whale-naturalists has split.\n\nBut it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the\nwhale, in his anatomy\u2014there, at least, we shall be able to hit the\nright classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the\nGreenland whale\u2019s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have\nseen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the\nGreenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various\nleviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as\navailable to the systematizer as those external ones already\nenumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales\nbodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.\nAnd this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only\none that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.\n\nBOOK I. (_Folio_) CHAPTER IV. (_Hump Back_).\u2014This whale is often seen\non the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there,\nand towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or\nyou might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the\npopular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the\nsperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very\nvaluable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of\nall the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any\nother of them.\n\nBOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER V. (_Razor Back_).\u2014Of this whale little is\nknown but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a\nretiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no\ncoward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which\nrises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor\ndoes anybody else.\n\nBOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER VI. (_Sulphur Bottom_).\u2014Another retiring\ngentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the\nTartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen;\nat least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and\nthen always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is\nnever chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are\ntold of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true\nof ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.\n\nThus ends BOOK I. (_Folio_), and now begins BOOK II.
