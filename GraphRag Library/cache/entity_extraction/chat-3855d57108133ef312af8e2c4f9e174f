But look\nsharp\u2014ain\u2019t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let\u2019s get\nthe whale alongside.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I remember some such story as you were telling,\u201d said Flask,\nwhen at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden\ntowards the ship, \u201cbut I can\u2019t remember where.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes?\nDid ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me,\nStubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was\nthe same you say is now on board the Pequod?\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn\u2019t the devil live\nfor ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any\nparson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a\nlatch-key to get into the admiral\u2019s cabin, don\u2019t you suppose he can\ncrawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you see that mainmast there?\u201d pointing to the ship; \u201cwell, that\u2019s\nthe figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod\u2019s hold, and string\nalong in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that\nwouldn\u2019t begin to be Fedallah\u2019s age. Nor all the coopers in creation\ncouldn\u2019t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you\nmeant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if\nhe\u2019s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to\nlive for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard\u2014tell me\nthat?\n\n\u201cGive him a good ducking, anyhow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019d crawl back.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuck him again; and keep ducking him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though\u2014yes, and\ndrown you\u2014what then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI should like to see him try it; I\u2019d give him such a pair of black\neyes that he wouldn\u2019t dare to show his face in the admiral\u2019s cabin\nagain for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he\nlives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn\nthe devil, Flask; so you suppose I\u2019m afraid of the devil? Who\u2019s afraid\nof him, except the old governor who daresn\u2019t catch him and put him in\ndouble-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping\npeople; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil\nkidnapped, he\u2019d roast for him? There\u2019s a governor!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I suppose it? You\u2019ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now\nto keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious\ngoing on, I\u2019ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say\u2014Look\nhere, Beelzebub, you don\u2019t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord\nI\u2019ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan,\nand give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come\nshort off at the stump\u2014do you see; and then, I rather guess when he\nfinds himself docked in that queer fashion, he\u2019ll sneak off without the\npoor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what will you do with the tail, Stubb?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;\u2014what else?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?\u201d\n\n\u201cMean or not mean, here we are at the ship.\u201d\n\nThe boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side,\nwhere fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for\nsecuring him.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you so?\u201d said Flask; \u201cyes, you\u2019ll soon see this right\nwhale\u2019s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti\u2019s.\u201d\n\nIn good time, Flask\u2019s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply\nleaned over towards the sperm whale\u2019s head, now, by the counterpoise of\nboth heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may\nwell believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke\u2019s head, you go\nover that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant\u2019s and you come\nback again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep\ntrimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard,\nand then you will float light and right.\n\nIn disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the\nship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the\ncase of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut\noff whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed\nand hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to\nwhat is called the crown-piece.
