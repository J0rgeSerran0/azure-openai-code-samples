It was cold as Iceland\u2014no fire at all\u2014the landlord said\nhe couldn\u2019t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a\nwinding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold\nto our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the\nfare was of the most substantial kind\u2014not only meat and potatoes, but\ndumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a\ngreen box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful\nmanner.\n\n\u201cMy boy,\u201d said the landlord, \u201cyou\u2019ll have the nightmare to a dead\nsartainty.\u201d\n\n\u201cLandlord,\u201d I whispered, \u201cthat aint the harpooneer is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \u201cthe\nharpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he\ndon\u2019t\u2014he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes \u2019em rare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe devil he does,\u201d says I. \u201cWhere is that harpooneer? Is he here?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be here afore long,\u201d was the answer.\n\nI could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this \u201cdark\ncomplexioned\u201d harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so\nturned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into\nbed before I did.\n\nSupper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not\nwhat else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the\nevening as a looker on.\n\nPresently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord\ncried, \u201cThat\u2019s the Grampus\u2019s crew. I seed her reported in the offing\nthis morning; a three years\u2019 voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now\nwe\u2019ll have the latest news from the Feegees.\u201d\n\nA tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\nopen, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their\nshaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,\nall bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they\nseemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from\ntheir boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then,\nthat they made a straight wake for the whale\u2019s mouth\u2014the bar\u2014when the\nwrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out\nbrimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon\nwhich Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he\nswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never\nmind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador,\nor on the weather side of an ice-island.\n\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even\nwith the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began\ncapering about most obstreperously.\n\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\nhe seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\nown sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\nnoise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the\nsea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\nbut a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I\nwill here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six\nfeet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I\nhave seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and\nburnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the\ndeep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem\nto give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a\nSoutherner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of\nthose tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When\nthe revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man\nslipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my\ncomrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his\nshipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with\nthem, they raised a cry of \u201cBulkington! Bulkington! where\u2019s\nBulkington?\u201d and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.\n\nIt was now about nine o\u2019clock, and the room seeming almost\nsupernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself\nupon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the\nentrance of the seamen.\n\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal\nrather not sleep with your own brother. I don\u2019t know how it is, but\npeople like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\nsleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,\nand that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely\nmultiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should\nsleep two\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
