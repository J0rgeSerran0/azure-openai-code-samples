Midnight.\u2014The Forecastle Bulwarks.\n\n_Stubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional lashings over\nthe anchors there hanging._\n\n\u201cNo, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but\nyou will never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how\nlong ago is it since you said the very contrary? Didn\u2019t you once say\nthat whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra\non its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with powder\nbarrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn\u2019t you say\nso?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, suppose I did? What then? I\u2019ve part changed my flesh since that\ntime, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we _are_ loaded with powder\nbarrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get\nafire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty\nred hair, but you couldn\u2019t get afire now. Shake yourself; you\u2019re\nAquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat\ncollar. Don\u2019t you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine\nInsurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask.\nBut hark, again, and I\u2019ll answer ye the other thing. First take your\nleg off from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the\nrope; now listen. What\u2019s the mighty difference between holding a mast\u2019s\nlightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that hasn\u2019t\ngot any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don\u2019t you see, you\ntimber-head, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the\nmast is first struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in\na hundred carries rods, and Ahab,\u2014aye, man, and all of us,\u2014were in no\nmore danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten\nthousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose\nyou would have every man in the world go about with a small\nlightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a militia\nofficer\u2019s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why\ndon\u2019t ye be sensible, Flask? it\u2019s easy to be sensible; why don\u2019t ye,\nthen? any man with half an eye can be sensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, when a fellow\u2019s soaked through, it\u2019s hard to be sensible, that\u2019s\na fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the\nturn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors\nnow as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two\nanchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man\u2019s hands behind him. And\nwhat big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron\nfists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the\nworld is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long\ncable, though. There, hammer that knot down, and we\u2019ve done. So; next\nto touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory.
