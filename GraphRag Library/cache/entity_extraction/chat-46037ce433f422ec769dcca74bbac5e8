Your hat, however, is the most\nconvenient.\n\nFrom the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part\nof the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you\nwould have thought the craft had two keels\u2014one cleaving the water, the\nother the air\u2014as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at\nonce. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy\nin her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a\nlittle finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic\ngunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main\nclinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall\nform of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order\nto bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics\nseemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale\nsomewhat slackened his flight.\n\n\u201cHaul in\u2014haul in!\u201d cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round\ntowards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while\nyet the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb,\nfirmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart\ninto the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately\nsterning out of the way of the whale\u2019s horrible wallow, and then\nranging up for another fling.\n\nThe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down\na hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which\nbubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun\nplaying upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection\ninto every face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men.\nAnd all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot\nfrom the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the\nmouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his\ncrooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again\nand again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and\nagain sent it into the whale.\n\n\u201cPull up\u2014pull up!\u201d he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale\nrelaxed in his wrath. \u201cPull up!\u2014close to!\u201d and the boat ranged along\nthe fish\u2019s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned\nhis long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully\nchurning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold\nwatch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of\nbreaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was\nthe innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting\nfrom his trance into that unspeakable thing called his \u201cflurry,\u201d the\nmonster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in\nimpenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft,\ninstantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from\nthat phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day.\n\nAnd now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into\nview; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting\nhis spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last,\ngush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees\nof red wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran\ndripping down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead, Mr. Stubb,\u201d said Daggoo.\n\n\u201cYes; both pipes smoked out!\u201d and withdrawing his own from his mouth,\nStubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood\nthoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.\n\n\nCHAPTER 62. The Dart.\n\nA word concerning an incident in the last chapter.\n\nAccording to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes\noff from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary\nsteersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost\noar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong,\nnervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what\nis called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the\ndistance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting\nthe chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the\nuttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman\nactivity to the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
