It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed\nwhirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze\nnow freshened; the sea began to swell.\n\n\u201cThe birds!\u2014the birds!\u201d cried Tashtego.\n\nIn long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now\nall flying towards Ahab\u2019s boat; and when within a few yards began\nfluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,\nexpectant cries. Their vision was keener than man\u2019s; Ahab could\ndiscover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down\ninto its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a\nwhite weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it\nrose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long\ncrooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the\nundiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick\u2019s open mouth and scrolled jaw;\nhis vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.\nThe glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble\ntomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled\nthe craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon\nFedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and\nseizing Perth\u2019s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and\nstand by to stern.\n\nNow, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\nits bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale\u2019s head while yet\nunder water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that\nmalicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\nhimself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\nlengthwise beneath the boat.\n\nThrough and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for\nan instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a\nbiting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his\nmouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into\nthe open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish\npearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab\u2019s\nhead, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale\nnow shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With\nunastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the\ntiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other\u2019s heads to gain the\nuttermost stern.\n\nAnd now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the\nwhale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his\nbody being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from\nthe bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while\nthe other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis\nimpossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with\nthis tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and\nhelpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized\nthe long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from\nits gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the\nfrail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an\nenormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in\ntwain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the\ntwo floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the\ncrew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold\nfast to the oars to lash them across.\n\nAt that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first\nto perceive the whale\u2019s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a\nmovement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had\nmade one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only\nslipping further into the whale\u2019s mouth, and tilting over sideways as\nit slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him\nout of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the\nsea.\n\nRipplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\ndistance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the\nbillows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;\nso that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose\u2014some twenty or more feet\nout of the water\u2014the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,\ndazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray\nstill higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel\nbillows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to\noverleap its summit with their scud.\n\n*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its\ndesignation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\nup-and-down poise\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
