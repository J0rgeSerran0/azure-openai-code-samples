But ashore,\nall this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller\nso proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his\ngrand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages\nthrough which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not\nunshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received\ngood turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would\nfain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming\nqualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm\nto back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In\nsum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is\nemphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so\nmany of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of\nmankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling\ncaptains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter,\nthat to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its\nline, the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole\ntransition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and\nrecklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.\n\n\u201c\u2018I see! I see!\u2019 impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha\nupon his silvery ruffles. \u2018No need to travel! The world\u2019s one Lima. I\nhad thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations were\ncold and holy as the hills.\u2014But the story.\u2019\n\n\u201cI left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly\nhad he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and\nthe four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down\nthe ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the\nuproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle.\nOthers of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted\nturmoil ensued; while standing out of harm\u2019s way, the valiant captain\ndanced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to\nmanhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the\nquarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of\nthe confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to\nprick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his\ndesperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the\nforecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks\nin a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves\nbehind the barricade.\n\n\u201c\u2018Come out of that, ye pirates!\u2019 roared the captain, now menacing them\nwith a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. \u2018Come\nout of that, ye cut-throats!\u2019\n\n\u201cSteelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,\ndefied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to\nunderstand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt\u2019s) death would be the signal\nfor a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart\nlest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but\nstill commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.\n\n\u201c\u2018Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?\u2019 demanded their\nringleader.\n\n\u201c\u2018Turn to! turn to!\u2014I make no promise;\u2014to your duty! Do you want to\nsink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!\u2019 and he\nonce more raised a pistol.\n\n\u201c\u2018Sink the ship?\u2019 cried Steelkilt. \u2018Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us\nturns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What\nsay ye, men?\u2019 turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their\nresponse.\n\n\u201cThe Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye\non the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:\u2014\u2018It\u2019s not our\nfault; we didn\u2019t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was\nboy\u2019s business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to\nprick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his\ncursed jaw; ain\u2019t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there,\nmen? look to those handspikes, my hearties.

I make no promises, turn to, I say!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Look ye, now,\u2019 cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,\n\u2018there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for\nthe cruise, d\u2019ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our\ndischarge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don\u2019t want a row; it\u2019s\nnot our interest; we want to be peaceable\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
