The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the\nvessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of\nthat unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.\n\nThey were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;\nthough it was put together of all contrasting things\u2014oak, and maple,\nand pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp\u2014yet all these ran into each\nother in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced\nand directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities\nof the crew, this man\u2019s valor, that man\u2019s fear; guilt and guiltiness,\nall varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that\nfatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.\n\nThe rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\noutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one\nhand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,\nshading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking\nyards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for\ntheir fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to\nseek out the thing that might destroy them!\n\n\u201cWhy sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?\u201d cried Ahab, when, after\nthe lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.\n\u201cSway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd\njet that way, and then disappears.\u201d\n\nIt was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some\nother thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for\nhardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its\npin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the\nair vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant\nhalloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as\u2014much nearer to the ship\nthan the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead\u2014Moby Dick\nbodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not\nby the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the\nWhite Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous\nphenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the\nfurthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the\npure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows\nhis place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those moments,\nthe torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases,\nthis breaching is his act of defiance.\n\n\u201cThere she breaches! there she breaches!\u201d was the cry, as in his\nimmeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to\nHeaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\nagainst the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\nfor the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\nstood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\nintensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\n\n\u201cAye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!\u201d cried Ahab, \u201cthy hour\nand thy harpoon are at hand!\u2014Down! down all of ye, but one man at the\nfore. The boats!\u2014stand by!\u201d\n\nUnmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\nshooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and\nhalyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped\nfrom his perch.\n\n\u201cLower away,\u201d he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat\u2014a spare one,\nrigged the afternoon previous. \u201cMr. Starbuck, the ship is thine\u2014keep\naway from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!\u201d\n\nAs if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first\nassailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the\nthree crews. Ahab\u2019s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told\nthem he would take the whale head-and-head,\u2014that is, pull straight up\nto his forehead,\u2014a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,\nsuch a course excludes the coming onset from the whale\u2019s sidelong\nvision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three\nboats were plain as the ship\u2019s three masts to his eye; the White Whale\nchurning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,\nrushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered\nappalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him\nfrom every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank\nof which those boats were made. But skilfully man\u0153uvred, incessantly\nwheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while\neluded him; though, at times, but by a plank\u2019s breadth; while all the\ntime, Ahab\u2019s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.\n\nBut at last in his\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
