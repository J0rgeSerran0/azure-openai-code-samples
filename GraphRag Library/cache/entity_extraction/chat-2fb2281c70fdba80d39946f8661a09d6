I try all\nthings; I achieve what I can.\n\nPhysiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He\nhas no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most\nconspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and\nfinally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that\nits entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect\nthe countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire,\ncupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable\nto the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in\nkeeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the\nnose from Phidias\u2019s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!\nNevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his\nproportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the\nsculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is\nan added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As\non your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your\njolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the\nreflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which\nso often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest\nroyal beadle on his throne.\n\nIn some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to\nbe had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This\naspect is sublime.\n\nIn thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the\nmorning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has\na touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles,\nthe elephant\u2019s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is\nas that great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their\ndecrees. It signifies\u2014\u201cGod: done this day by my hand.\u201d But in most\ncreatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip\nof alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which\nlike Shakespeare\u2019s or Melancthon\u2019s rise so high, and descend so low,\nthat the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes;\nand all above them in the forehead\u2019s wrinkles, you seem to track the\nantlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters\ntrack the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this\nhigh and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely\namplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the\nDeity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other\nobject in living nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one\ndistinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;\nhe has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a\nforehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats,\nand ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish;\nthough that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In\nprofile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic\ndepression in the forehead\u2019s middle, which, in man, is Lavater\u2019s mark\nof genius.\n\nBut how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a\nbook, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing\nnothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his\npyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale\nbeen known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified by\ntheir child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile,\nbecause the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue,\nor at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of\nprotrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall\nlure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and\nlivingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now\nunhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove\u2019s high seat, the great\nSperm Whale shall lord it.\n\nChampollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is\nno Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man\u2019s and every being\u2019s\nface. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing\nfable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could\nnot read the simplest peasant\u2019s face in its profounder and more subtle\nmeanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of\nthe Sperm Whale\u2019s brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you\ncan.\n\n\nCHAPTER 80. The Nut.\n\nIf the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist\nhis brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to\nsquare.\n\nIn the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet\nin length.
