In stunsails! Down\ntop-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay\non board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So;\nsteady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All\nready the boats there? Stand by, stand by!

Boats, boats!\u201d\n\nSoon all the boats but Starbuck\u2019s were dropped; all the boat-sails\nset\u2014all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to\nleeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up\nFedallah\u2019s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.\n\nLike noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;\nbut only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew\nstill more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a\nnoon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter\ncame so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling\nhump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated\nthing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy,\ngreenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly\nprojecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged\nwaters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky\nforehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and\nbehind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving\nvalley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and\ndanced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of\nhundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their\nfitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull\nof an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected\nfrom the white whale\u2019s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of\nsoft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over\nthe fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail\nfeathers streaming like pennons.\n\nA gentle joyousness\u2014a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested\nthe gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with\nravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering\neyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,\nrippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that\ngreat majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so\ndivinely swam.\n\nOn each soft side\u2014coincident with the parted swell, that but once\nleaving him, then flowed so wide away\u2014on each bright side, the whale\nshed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who\nnamelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured\nto assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of\ntornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all\nwho for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way\nthou may\u2019st have bejuggled and destroyed before.\n\nAnd thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among\nwaves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby\nDick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his\nsubmerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.\nBut soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an\ninstant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia\u2019s\nNatural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air,\nthe grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.\nHoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls\nlongingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.\n\nWith oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,\nthe three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick\u2019s reappearance.\n\n\u201cAn hour,\u201d said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat\u2019s stern; and he gazed\nbeyond the whale\u2019s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing\nvacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed\nwhirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze\nnow freshened; the sea began to swell.\n\n\u201cThe birds!\u2014the birds!\u201d cried Tashtego.\n\nIn long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-32k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
