What\nthen should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing\nwonderful? By Golconda! let me read it once. Halloa! here\u2019s signs and\nwonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the\nzodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. I\u2019ll get the almanac and\nas I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll\u2019s arithmetic, I\u2019ll try\nmy hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the\nMassachusetts calendar. Here\u2019s the book. Let\u2019s see now. Signs and\nwonders; and the sun, he\u2019s always among \u2019em. Hem, hem, hem; here they\nare\u2014here they go\u2014all alive:\u2014Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and\nJimimi! here\u2019s Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels\namong \u2019em. Aye, here on the coin he\u2019s just crossing the threshold\nbetween two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there;\nthe fact is, you books must know your places. You\u2019ll do to give us the\nbare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That\u2019s my\nsmall experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch\u2019s\nnavigator, and Daboll\u2019s arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if\nthere is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders!\nThere\u2019s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist\u2014hark! By Jove, I have it!\nLook you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round\nchapter; and now I\u2019ll read it off, straight out of the book. Come,\nAlmanack! To begin: there\u2019s Aries, or the Ram\u2014lecherous dog, he begets\nus; then, Taurus, or the Bull\u2014he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini,\nor the Twins\u2014that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo!\ncomes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue,\nLeo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path\u2014he gives a few fierce bites and\nsurly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that\u2019s\nour first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes\nLibra, or the Scales\u2014happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we\nare very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the\nScorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang\ncome the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing\nhimself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here\u2019s the\nbattering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing,\nand headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours\nout his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the\nFishes, we sleep. There\u2019s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the\nsun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and\nhearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and\nso, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly\u2019s the word for aye! Adieu,\nDoubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the\ntry-works, now, and let\u2019s hear what he\u2019ll have to say. There; he\u2019s\nbefore it; he\u2019ll out with something presently. So, so; he\u2019s beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises\na certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what\u2019s all this\nstaring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that\u2019s true; and at\ntwo cents the cigar, that\u2019s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won\u2019t\nsmoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here\u2019s nine\nhundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy \u2019em out.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a\nfoolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of\nwiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman\u2014the old\nhearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea.\nHe luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other\nside of the mast; why, there\u2019s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and\nnow he\u2019s back again; what does that mean? Hark! he\u2019s muttering\u2014voice\nlike an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when\nthe sun stands in some one of these signs. I\u2019ve studied signs, and know\ntheir marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch\nin Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be?
