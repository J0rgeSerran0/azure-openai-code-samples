Still, no\nsign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,\nthat mainly at Steelkilt\u2019s instigation, they had resolved to maintain\nthe strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the\nship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the\nspeediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing\u2014namely,\nnot to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,\nspite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still\nmaintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower\nfor a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the\ncruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his\nberth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the\nvital jaw of the whale.\n\n\u201cBut though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\npassiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till\nall was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the\nman who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney\nthe chief mate\u2019s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more\nthan half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he\ninsisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the\nhead of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other\ncircumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.\n\n\u201cDuring the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the\nbulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of\nthe boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship\u2019s side. In\nthis attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a\nconsiderable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between\nthis was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his\nnext trick at the helm would come round at two o\u2019clock, in the morning\nof the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his\nleisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully\nin his watches below.\n\n\u201c\u2018What are you making there?\u2019 said a shipmate.\n\n\u201c\u2018What do you think? what does it look like?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Like a lanyard for your bag; but it\u2019s an odd one, seems to me.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes, rather oddish,\u2019 said the Lakeman, holding it at arm\u2019s length\nbefore him; \u2018but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven\u2019t enough\ntwine,\u2014have you any?\u2019\n\n\u201cBut there was none in the forecastle.\n\n\u201c\u2018Then I must get some from old Rad;\u2019 and he rose to go aft.\n\n\u201c\u2018You don\u2019t mean to go a begging to _him!_\u2019 said a sailor.\n\n\u201c\u2018Why not? Do you think he won\u2019t do me a turn, when it\u2019s to help\nhimself in the end, shipmate?\u2019 and going to the mate, he looked at him\nquietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given\nhim\u2014neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an\niron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the\nLakeman\u2019s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock\nfor a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent\nhelm\u2014nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready\ndug to the seaman\u2019s hand\u2014that fatal hour was then to come; and in the\nfore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and\nstretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.\n\n\u201cBut, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody\ndeed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the\navenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in\nto take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have\ndone.\n\n\u201cIt was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second\nday, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe\nman, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, \u2018There\nshe rolls! there she rolls!\u2019 Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.\n\n\u201c\u2018Moby Dick!\u2019 cried Don Sebastian; \u2018St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do\nwhales have christenings?
